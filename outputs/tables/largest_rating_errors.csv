"The day after I posted the review here on yelp concerning my horrible experience at Aladdin's, I received a phone call from the store's general manager, Mike. After apologizing profusely for the previous day's missteps, he explained that he was not present when my situation was handled, & that he had new people working that day. He assured me that he coached the responsible staff on the importance of high quality customer service & to never allow anything like that to occur again. In the end, he offered me a free meal any time I'd like--to just give him a call & he'd take care of it. I happened to be just heading home from work & was starving so I ordered the Eggplant Parmigiana Sandwich with their Old Bay fries on the side. Happy to take care of my order, he even threw in another Peach Cobbler, noting I had ordered one the night before, & assured a speedy arrival. Sure enough, not long after I arrived home, (not even 25 minutes later) my phone rang with my delivery outside. The driver apologized for the previous day's mishap as well, clearly knowing who he was delivering food to, and ensured me they took great care to make me the ""Best sandwich [I'd] ever have!"" As always, the food was just a tad spicier than most other pizza places in the area, but the quality was great! And (in my opinion) even more importantly, so was the fantastic customer service!",5,1,4
"THE best pizza, generous toppings, fair price. The only bad thing is the rude girl that works there. Customer service goes a long way...",5,1,4
Screw those that rate this a 3 star place.. It's a bar people! And the food is good. Beer is cold. And they have happy hour!,5,1,4
"Zahav is a wonderful restaurant, but in order to appreciate a good restaurant, I would need to be able to make a reservation. I woke up at midnight to make a reservation for the next available day for reservations (May 19) just for there to instantly be no availability for a party greater than 2 people at any point. Obviously the restaurant is doing great, and I applaud their success, but I only wish a normal person could get a reservation (apparently I won't be going back here).",1,5,4
I been coming here for years I love this place the food is awesome and the waitresses are so. Friendly they treat you like family well some do Janine is one of the few that take pride in her job she's very outgoing and attentive always checks on me and makes sure my coffee is filled and askes me if I need anything else like I said she is one of the few than there are others that are just plain out rude like marybeth she can be ignorant at times I've even seen her be rude to her fellow employees I observe while I eat lol but sometimes it's kinda hard not to notice the the very much noticeable stuff that goes on from some of the employees like Mary Beth who needs an attitude adjustment along with training on dealing with the busy public just don't get stuck with her when you go in here to eat ask for Janine or one of the other nice waitresses like ruthie or Maria they will make sure your well takin care of!,5,1,4
"Saw the poor reviews after group of coworkers decided to go here, and was a bit worried, thinking we should head to Gino's instead. But this was a PERFECT cheesesteak! The bread... yum.",5,1,4
"For years this place had the best breakfast burrito in the country & a top notch assortment of tacos and burritos. Now it's sadly gone - a thing of the past, relegated to a memory. The new menu is overpriced ($10 for a scoop of rice & underseasoned veg -???) and the flavor is all gone. A tragic reminder of West Philly's decline into bohemian privilege",1,5,4
How can any Philly citizen eat this garbage when we have some of the best bread and sandwiches in the country!! I have no idea how this franchise can survive in this city!,1,5,4
"We ordered food on Grubhub from Bleu and realized we had the wrong address.. we just moved and still had the old address attached. We went to change the address and we were out of their delivery zone and instead of canceling the order we drove to the restaurant (yes the food is that good). When I got there, I met Hendra for the first time and he was very polite and apologetic for the inconvenience even though it was our fault! He gave us a 20% off our next purchase and two free drinks. We will definitely be back for both the food and customer service! We only ever got delivery, but after COVID I cannot wait to eat there because after picking up the food I saw how cute the restaurant was. Thanks Hendra! (From Ashley and Tim)",5,1,4
Staying at the Marriott and got carry out. Eggplant Parmigiana and Italian side salad. I was not going to eat whole thing but I could not stop. Great sauce. Yummm!,5,1,4
"Literally made an account to write this. It was a cold afternoon. My dad came over from Maryland and asked if I wanted to try something new. I said, ""Sure, why not,"" not thinking much of it. He ordered from ""Golden Triangle"" and told me that his coworker recommended it. We had the roti canai and the pad Thai. They were so good! Roti canai had a nice rich feeling to it and I felt at home (due to being raised in Southeast Asia). I love this place and recommend it to all my friends in the area.",5,1,4
One of my go to restaurants in China town! Never disappoints! Make sure to bring cash though because they don't take card. Although there is an ATM inside,5,1,4
Their tacos are the trashiest Americanized thing I've ever had. They had sour cream and cheese in them which is not included in authentic tacos. Also their veggje tacos are just beans combined with wheat bread from Safeway.,1,5,4
"I am so happy to see Nom Nom reopen after the month long renovation, however , I am so disappointed of the Ramen . What happened guys ? Nom Nom used to be my favorite place to fulfill my ramen craving in philly and I have raved about it to every single person I know . I will no longer return after this time . My favorite part about the Ramen from Nom Nom was their creamy broth, it hurt every taste bud on my tongue and was always made to perfection . The broth now is watered down , it was so flavorless and tasted like water plus instant noodle seasoning packets. The braised pork are thinly sliced now and on top of that one of the pieces was a half piece of pork. I understand how after the reopening you need to raise the price , which is no big deal. But , with this kind of quality ? I am so sad I have just lost a favorite restaurant from the city.",1,5,4
"There are so many different vendors here that I basically go to RTM to look around like a tourist. From sweet to savory to inedible, RTM has it all. I recommend going to the Harvest Festival, which I thought was very fun.",5,1,4
Second time visiting in The last year. Food tast like it's been just sitting around. Definitely not fresh. Back in the day it was exceptionally good. Must be the new management. This is my last time coming.,1,5,4
"A lot of the wholesome looking food is secretly loaded with sugar, watch out!",1,5,4
"We know now but ordering our first time was a rushed experience requiring you to keep an eye on which sandwich is which and only accepting cash. At least we knew that we wanted onions. I knew that the cheese-wiz was the best option but you can't tell people what they want, sometimes they just have to learn the hard way. There are peppers if you want a complete experience, fries are not necessary. Just bring your own water or buy a drink.",5,1,4
yeah this place is super flame. some really tasty food and alot of it for not alot of money. if you care about healthiness you wont feel guilty. if you dont you wont feel like your eating health food. as someone who is a little underimpressed by the food scene in the neighborhood WEST PHILLY IS SLEEPING ON THIS PLACE!!,5,1,4
This place is definitely not closed because my date and and I are sitting here and we just ordered food Date 02/07/20,5,1,4
"This restaurant has TREMENDOUS service! I went to this restaurant as a part of a trip to the east coast and decided to stop by since the reviews were good. One of the servers accidentally dropped a plate of food, and not only were multiple servers apologetic and acknowledging of their mistake, they went out of their way to make sure the customer was happy by constantly checking in and even providing complementary drinks on the house!",5,1,4
"I was so displeased about being yelled at by some man who is a manager, not Doug. Hana was great and Doug was personable. I hate that I cannot",1,5,4
"excellent. can't believe i never stopped in here before. the building facade is misleading in that this place is super cool. it's weird how you go downstairs and order and then chill upstairs, but it's worth it. note to everyone: the hours on yelp are wrong. they don't close at 9. they close at 7. we were kicked out at 7, quite kindly, but asked to leave nonetheless.",5,1,4
First time I came to this place the food was amazing had the chicken and waffles and the creme brûlée French toast and the service was really good I came back and the service was horrible the good was not hot at all and it jus wasn't the same experience time to find a new place to eat,1,5,4
"My main point is not to critique their pizza. But i just wanted to make a note that their pizza has high quality ingredients. The doe is crispy but not to the point where its stabbing/clawing your mouth ceiling. It has a great balance between the doe, topping and sauce. To my main point: my experience on 2/21/14. It was about 10 or so and the place starting to get jammed packed with people. The Owner took our, me and the Mrs., we ordered a pie of Forbes and bought drinks and sat down. We waited and waited and waited. Then one of the workers realized we didn't have our pizza yet. He checked out the status (the slip got lost in the mayhem, understandable). It was MUCH busier than usual. The worker told the chefs to expedite our order, and told the Owner about why we didn't get out pizza. The Owner felt bad/embarrassed that he apologized sincerely and gave back half of what we paid, which was the pizza and 2 drinks. Pizza finally came and we wolfed it down, took home 2 slices. When we left, walking towards my car, the Owner came out with a MEGAPHONE and sincerely apologized again. After that he rushed back into the mayhem. I just wanted to share that with whoever is reading this. The experience was unexpected and great. Job well done Mr. Owner.",5,1,4
"Wednesday night quizzo is the best in the city. Great servers and quizzo Kevin is hilarious. I would give it 5 stars, but I hear quizzo Kevin is not coming back, therefore, I won't be back. #BringBackQuizzoKevin #AndTheFriedOreos",1,5,4
How this place gets so many stars I just don't know. Devil's food cake with cheap icing and chocolate shavings does not make a great cake. If you are in a pinch for a good cake go to the Whole Foods at 20th & Callowhill and they can generally letter up a birthday cake for you with a quickness.,1,5,4
Just moved to the north east and was looking everywhere for a decent pizza place! Finally found one. I wouldn't go anywhere else.,5,1,4

"This was the first ramen place I ever tried in Philly, but definitely not the best ramen. This spot has a lot of buzz surrounding it from word of mouth, but the buzz doesn't necessarily reflect the quality. The ramen broth is watery and has little taste, and the noodles are just as bland and like plastic, they don't seem as fresh as how real ramen noodles should be. Plus, you only get half of an egg. Even their other dishes like katsudon and takoyaki are medicore at best and lack flavor and authenticity. tl;dr overrated ramen spot, far from authentic, try other places before thinking this is the best ramen in the city (coming from a frequent Japan traveler)",1,5,4
Simply the most OVER RATED pork sandwich I've ever had... I had very high hopes for this pork sandwich and when I tried it I was very disappointed with the lack of flavor!!!! Their cheese steaks are the highlight of this place!!!! Their prices are about par for the course!!!!!,1,5,4
i was in this bar when jfk was killed 11/22/1963. i was under 21 and eating a cheese burgher with a beer. i was 18 and they didn't card me.,5,1,4
"May William Penn smite the person who says a word against this place. It's a staple for a cold beer and hot wings on any game night. The only time McGillin's disappointed me was when I made the mistake of coming in on Cinco de Mayo for ""authentic Mexican drinks."" Note: the Irish never made a mojito or caipirinha (additional note that a caipirinha is brazilian and an Irish pub would only ignore that fact and call it ""authentic Mexican drinks"") and they never will. I will stick to the beautiful things: their pitchers of beer and beef nachos.",5,1,4
"Finally! A pizza place that doesn't give you soggy thin crust lazy excuse for drunk satisfaction. Doughy crust I love, actually good bacon, first time delivered small pizza and sandwich in *12 minutes* and second time a small pizza and app in 15. Both on Saturdays ... even reasonably priced - I have found my pizza place",5,1,4
I put in a pretty large order through Grubhub and was a bit concerned when it had been an hour and nothing showed up. Called in a they told me that the driver had left with it about 15 minutes ago. Another 45 minutes went by... nothing. I called back in and they were pretty great about the whole thing. Ended up making a whole new order and the woman I was talking to drove it over herself. Food was very good. The original order did end up showing up with the food pretty much destroyed and the driver looking like he had done all the drugs. I woke up this morning and I had an email saying that they refunded me. Long story short I believe that customer service like that goes a very long way. Great job to the Seiko team!,5,1,4
"I like this joint. Sours this week-ewwww, but no worries 568 other brews to choose from.",5,1,4
The guy working the cashier (seems like he may be the manager) was unbelievably pleasant. Very attentive to his customers - I'm gluten free. He was patient with me and my requests and helped customize my order. I got a veggie omelette with melted cheese and roasted potatoes. Delish! I took a double take to remind myself I was in an airport and not at a gourmet breakfast cafe. I paid $13 (included my bottle of water) Try this place. You won't be disappointed.,5,1,4
Call Philadelphia taxi cab at 5:19 in the morning so it would be 10 to 15 minutes never showed up called again at 6:14 a.m. and never showed up again are the worst taxi cab in the city,5,1,4

"Cheap drinks and decent food. I actually left a bag of concert memorabilia on my table Saturday night. I figured I would never see it again. I called the bar at 7:00 am, on a Sunday, and a man answered and told me my bag was there. Honesty deserves a 5 star review. Thank you so much.",5,1,4
I had the grilled chicken platter as tasty as I have ever had tasted like steak,5,1,4
My girlfriend recently visited this restaurant and told me I had to try it for myself so we did brunch this morning. Unfortunately we had a terrible waiter that made us feel like us being there was an inconvenience. By the end of the meal which was fantastic by the way I asked to speak to the manager. Mike (manager) came over and we told him about our experience and he was extremely polite and rectified the situation in our eyes. Will definitely visit this restaurant again as we noticed the other wait staff were very professional.,5,1,4
"I have been meaning to write this review for so long because that's how sweet they are! I went there for my manager's birthday and because I had been dying to try byreks. When I got there, the owner (I'm so sorry I don't know if I ever asked what your name was) asked me about my manager and I told him it was a surprise for his birthday. Once he heard that, he threw in aryan in the house! I thought it was just milk LOL (I was close)! Anyway, my manager Chim was so happy and even thought I made the byreks hahahaha I wish. Shumë falemimderit!!! :p",5,1,4
"I placed an order at @ 11:25pm, I walked in 11:40. The guys at the front were excellent, I gave my name they told me I was coming and that they were behind. That means so much to me as a customer, one gentleman came out and said my name looked me in my eye and told where my order was and how much time was left, look for me that meant so much again. I paid for my food everything was hot & accounted for. I realize I mite be in the minority but this service is way better then location on Stenton Avenue, thanks again guys. I really appreciate it !!!",5,1,4
I found out about this place on Valentine's Day after a news article came across my feed about their heart shaped pizza. I called last minute on a whim to see if I could get one for my little one. The customer service I received from the counter lady was beyond compare. They made a little girl smile brighter than all of Vegas and for that I'll be forever grateful,5,1,4
I always seek out the neighborhood bars when I go to other cities..stepped in here a year ago..been coming back ever since when I'm Philadelphia... Post prohibition bar..and the roast beef on roll..sliced from an antique slicer in front of you..will knock.your socks off...jus go..,5,1,4
"We have been patrons of Devon for many years. We've always enjoyed the ambience, the food & the servers. A few years ago, we even had a surprise birthday for my wife there and have celebrated other occasions there as a couple and with friends. We were there just this last Wed. nite (12/13) to celebrate our anniversary. As usual, the food was fine and our server, Donte, was terrific. Being that it was our anniversary (and we made that known when we made reservations) I was surprised we didn't get a small complimentary dessert (as we had on other special occasions), but that was by no means a big deal and, in no way negatively impacted our visit. Here's what bothered me. I ordered a Moscow Mule from the drink menu. Crazily enough, the menu listed the price of the Moscow Mule as $1. I mentioned it to Donte and he said he had seen that before & thought it had been corrected (to $11). We both joked about it (Donte asked me if I would really want a drink that only cost a $1) and went on to have an excellent dinner. Upon leaving the restaurant I mentioned the typo to the two young female hostesses and a young man (the manager?) at the front door. Again, we were joking about it, but I'm not sure the manager took my comments as a joke. He kept rolling his eyes at everything I said, never addressed the misprint and then dismissively said ""Have a nice night,"" & walked away from me as if I was bothering him. Maybe I took this too seriously (it's possible) but I really felt as I was being treated in a rude, insulting manner. As a long-time and regular customer, I didn't like being treated that way (and, by the way, I didn't make the typo and I wasn't the person who didn't bother to correct it). Ironically, we have reservations at Devon this coming Sun. (Christmas eve nite) with another couple, so, obviously, that instance isn't going to effect my patronage of your restaurant. This is just a little note to remind you that the staff of any restaurant should be aware of how they're acting (and also that the people who put together the restaurant should proofread their work...or maybe honor their misprint...instead of making the customer feel as if they were wrong to bring it up).",5,1,4
"OK, so my girl and I visited last night (Saturday) at 1am because she got out of work late and was having a shitty night and mind you, my girl and I both work in the restaurant industry (unfortunately) so we are very well aware of leaving accordingly by closing time and leaving a standard tip; but NICOLE, our bartender of the night was so accommodating. We left her a 45% tip. She assured us that we were not being rushed and we felt her genuine words. We already knew we had less than an hour or so to dabble here and there and we live right around the corner and made a random stop and did not regret it. Nicole was very attentive and we have already established that we will be coming back for her genuine service. She has such a sweet soul.",5,1,4
"I wanted a fried fish platter so looked in yelp and decided to gove this place a try. I called in and ordered a whiting platter with mac and yams. The lady on the phone asked if I wanted a small or large. I asked what the difference was in the sizes and the difference in price and she said it comes with 2 sides. She said the platter was $10 so I just ordered it not caring about the size. I asked how long she said 25 minutes. I arrived about 30 minutes just to give them more time. I advised the young lady I was there to pick up my food she asked for a number. I said I was not given a number but I ordered a fish platter and was told 25 minutes. She said she didnt have an order. As I was about to walk out a gentleman who I assume was the owner asked what was going on at which time the young lady noticed another employee wrote down the order and left. He immediately apologized and advised he could have the platter ready within 5 minutes. He also offered me a free drink which is not much but it shows the value me as a customer. Now to the food... AWESOME!!!! Fish fried perfect, yams and mac great and the cornbread was delicious too! Had the owner not been there I would have never had the chance to taste this awesome food. Good customer service makes a difference!!!",5,1,4

"I can't believe I'm saying this about a bbq shop, but Siu Kee has been getting on my nerves lately. They undoubtedly have the best bbq in Chinatown (bbq pork, roast pork, roast duck - all delicious), but they also will serve you inedible scraps if you don't watch them closely. Twice now I have sat down, opened my takeout container, and discovered meatless pieces of roast duck or foul, black liver. Makes me mad that they would serve food they obviously wouldn't eat.",1,5,4
"I originally called to see if they were open (labor day). The manager who was not at the shop called to verify that they indeed were still open. Very outgoing and personable service. Made me feel right at home. Lots of options to eat and drink, set up like a home, warm decor, all lead to a very satisfying experience. Will return soon. matt mayhem",5,1,4
"It's Pats. It's the original cheesesteak. What else do you want? You want a cannoli, go somewhere else.",5,1,4
"I can't say enough about this place. I never order from anywhere else. But today they went above and beyond. I ordered the wrong thing. I did. And when I called to order the right thing, they sent it at no charge. Great food and old school customer service!",5,1,4
Tried to stop here on fri 6/7 and much to my sadness it was closed!!!,5,1,4
"About a year ago I was planning a surprise milestone birthday party for my wife and I was looking for something that she could go and do for an evening with her friends that would different, fun, and hip. As an accident on tripadvisor I saw people discussing North Bowl and Lucky Strike and I decided that would be the route I would go. Initially I called Lucky Strike as they were more of ""the name"" and I got a quick call back from one of their reps who after she found out that I ""only"" wanted to rent a lane with food and open bar for three hours for six seemed mildly interested as apparently on a Saturday if you're not bringing double-digits they don't want to talk to you. I then contacted North Bowl via their website and I heard nothing for about a day and a half. I was unimpressed with the price list and food from Lucky Strike but was going to probably go with them when the phone rang. It was Leemore from Northbowl and she was apologetic when she found out that no one had contacted me about my inquiry and from there we talked about three times over the next week to nail down the details and everything with her came together quick, easy, and on budget. Leemore truly is the person that made this happen as she was more than willing to listen to what I wanted and was willing to customize a bit while being objective with what things usually work and don't work food, alcohol and package wise. While the food is more bar-type food than Lucky Strike the overall menu is more diverse and they are much more willing to work with you to find a package that works. On the day of the party Leemore even showed up and personally greeted my wife and her friends and made them fell very welcomed and really made sure they had a great time. (And that they got drunk past the point of reason. Thank God there were strong garbage bags for the ride home.) North Bowl truly was a winner and I can't say enough good things about everything from start to finish.",5,1,4
"My one stop after getting a hair cut..been doing this for yrs..why I do this, well because I'm a retard and drive 40 min from home just to come to the same barbershop, and can't beat food n drinks.",5,1,4
"No frills, they're not in business to make friends. It's possible but not probable. The service is prompt which is why they don't waste time being too nice. The sandwiches are the best in the tri-state area and I've been eating here for 30 years!!!",5,1,4
"I had an issue come up with my food and called the restaurant to complain. within. ten minutes the OWNER himself came to us to apologize and explain what had happened. This is exactly what customer service should be, and this man exemplifies what it means to be a business owner, and a leader.",5,1,4
"After a fascinating, self-guided tour of the original penitentiary across the street we needed a cup of coffee. This pleasant, spacious place took good care of us. We did not eat, but the food we saw looked good. Also, save your penitentiary tour receipt for a 10% discount!",5,1,4
"Very disappointed......haven't been here in years and brought our daughter here for dinner as we are in the city for medical test tomorrow. An Irish Pub without Bangers and Mash, Shepard's Pie, Irish Stew!!!!! They did have a lot of burgers, salads, some sandwiches and Fish Tacos! So much for a nice Irish dinner at an Irish Pub. We passed a nice looking Germane restaurant but kept walking thinking we were having bangers and mash. Very very disappointed!!!",1,5,4
"Rybread makes me crave food I don't even like...what's a scone anyways? Who cares, they make them cheesy and bacon-y and mmmmmm!!!!! Carrot cake is gross, but not at Rybread topped with half a pound of cream cheese icing (secret ingredient: crack?)! I even enjoy the carrot chunks for some reason. Who knew?",5,1,4
"Today was a rough day for both me and my friend. But we decided what better way to turn a bad day into a great day than to order from our local Domino's. Boy, were we pleasantly surprised. Not only did the pizza arrive in less than a half hour, but we also had a blast tracking it. We thought that once the order arrived, we would be completely underwhelmed and disgusted. On the contrary, Domino's garlic bread sticks and cinnamon knots taste like they are dusted in crack. We highly recommend the garlic butter dipping sauce. Although, a word of caution: if the world continues at this rate, we are all going to look like the people from Wall-E. Thank you, Domino's. Danger is your middle name but Delicious is your first.",5,1,4
"I just finished the second-best tacos I've ever had in my life...and they were made in a trailer. That's pretty damn impressive. I read on here & elsewhere that the lines for this place are long. Either they're suddenly hurting for business, or the students are all to busy moving in today to seek out awesome tacos, because there was no line when I got there. In any case, I called in my order...you should too, because presumably that will keep you from having to wait in line (in the event that a line exists).",5,1,4
A small place but excellent service.eating here a half dozen times or so with and without friends never have I had bad food or bad service,5,1,4
"The 7 years I've dined here, I've never had an issue with their food or their service. At times, the owner gives me Thai tea on the house. I love their thai sausage fried rice, chicken satay, and lemon grass soup! The flavors are never off. Honesty, I don't think I've never had a bad time here. One time, I was charge more than what it was supposed to be. Well, my girlfriend had picked the food up. So, I didn't know what it was supposed to be. The owner had called me and stated that he overcharged us, he kept sincerely apologizing. I started to feel bad instead. He told me he'll credit me next time I come in (it was about a $20 difference). However, I didn't dine in or order out in a couple of weeks and when I did, he remembered about the credit. That right there shows how much he loves and enjoys his customers!!! You'll forever have a customer unless I find something in my food (which I hope will never happen).",5,1,4
This place is no more Cajun then McDonald's! I'm from the south and visiting your nice city of Philly. So I thought I would entertain the idea of coming to a Cajun restaurant in the middle of Philly. Yeah no! Might as well convert The Joint to Philly cheesesteak restaurant and compete with everybody else. Just because it's different than Salt and Pepper doesn't mean it's spicy just saying! If you want real Cajun go to Louisiana. The Catahoula family is nowhere near Louisiana more like Pennsylvania.,1,5,4

"I always have a good experience at this location. Today I went through the drive through and opted to try the new queso & bacon fries with a frosty. I requested no bacon but received it anyway. I went inside to exchange it. The employee at the counter assisted me immediately and cheerfully, apologized for the mistake, and gave me extra queso.",5,1,4
"Waited for someone to seat us for about 7 minutes. The waitress provided good customer service. The food was good. We tried sangria of the day. The bartender said they don't have flavors of the day ""the menu lies"" the one he did make was horrible and I paid $6 for a non sangria drink.",5,1,4
"As a loyal fan of the original location I decided to pick up my favorite, Bistro Bella, when I found myself in west philly this evening. I'm sad to say there is a big difference in quality between these two locations. I've never had anything but a perfectly seasoned and crafted meal at their rittenhouse location and this was anything but. For starters, the bun was stale and not grilled on the flat top, the mushroom was under seasoned and undercooked -watery and rubbery. The usually delicious toppings of arugula (way too much was carelessly piled on!), artichoke (cut in large awkward chunks), and olive tapenade were put on so haphazardly that you could barely eat it. I love you HCV, which is why I'm writing this- please check the food your serving! West Philly deserves an option as delicious as your original.",1,5,4
"This is my freaking oasis. Cozy chair, glass of wine, free wifi - what more can a lady want when she's got an hour to kill at the airport? I breezed through security today and made a beeline here, only to see it completely empty. A glance at the time...yep, not quite noon. Sigh. I took my shamed self elsewhere for lunch, and was thrilled to see Vino Volo filling up a half hour later. No one wants to be the first person at the wine bar in the airport before noon. Minor criticisms: there needs to be less absurdly priced wine ($30 a glass) and way more mid-range ($10). I had to choose a petite syrah from the three in the ""cheapo"" section ($9) that definitely could've stood to have more body. But who am I kidding? I'm drinking wine in the airport at noon.

"After walking the B Terminal this was the first place that a person greeted us. I realize the iPads are an effective way to conduct business, but they eliminate the human touch. Our server, Daniel, was personable and helpful to those around us who were having difficulty with the ordering process. He stepped in several times to assist confused and/or frustrated customers. In short, Daniel and those working with him, made this a great airport experience.",5,1,4
"What makes a top-rated restaurant? Outstanding service, with a waitstaff that appears happy you've decided to dine at their establishment, and outstanding food. Vernick has neither. We started our evening at the bar where a very surly bartender waited on us. And that set the tone for the remainder of our evening. The food was medicore at best and the waitstaff (with the exception of one lovely young man) treated us as if they were doing us a favor. As we left, we overheard a couple talking about their dining experience. The gentlemen said: ""it was OK, but certainly not worth waiting four months for a reservation. And what's with the attitude?"" Sums up our experience as well. We neither recommend nor will we be back.",1,5,4
Exactly what I needed after trudging across the city in the snow. I knew what I wanted so I wasn't bothered by the guy staring at me until I told him what I wanted. It took under 2 minutes for my food to get to me. And maybe only a few seconds longer than that for me to devour it. I'll definitely be back.,5,1,4
"Updated review (4/1/16) So yeah, Tres Jalapeños is no longer my go to place for Mexican. I mean...the service and food now is just terrible. We (my coworkers and friends) would eat here at least 3-4 times a week. When friends from out of town would come I would always take them there. They even mention on Facebook how they can't wait to visit Philly again and always want to go to TJ. Sadly it's been over a month since I've been there, same goes for my friends. It all started when the majority of the staff quit. The only original staff member there now is Laura, who is there every single day now (not good). The new staff is so weird. Most of them don't even speak English. The past 3 times I've eaten there my order has been messed up (I've eaten the same thing there for YEARS) then old staff would usually have our orders in before we even made it completely through the door. They were awesome. They would sit and talk with us, give us tons of extra chips. It was great. Even the salsa sucks now. Even my barber brought it up to me because he knows how much we all loved that place. I am genuinely sad to now give them a 1 star review. If any member of management is reading this, you REALLY need to get your act together. I would happily spend $700+ a month there before. ------------------------------------------------- Original review: I love Tres Jalapenos. Coming here form the south, I fould it very hard to get good mexican food (we're spoiled down there). I order from TJ at least 3 times a week. The food is always great, and the delivery guys are really good to deal with. I try to pick my food up, though, as I feel bad having them bike through a bad neighborhood to get to my place.",1,5,4
"This was my first time here and it was a seamless experience! You can place your order at the kiosks when you walk in the door or you can order at the counter. No sooner had I submitted my order and I got a text message saying my order was ready for pick-up at the counter. The next minute, my name was being called and picked up my shake and left. The inside of the building was clean and organized. The employees were working really hard and were getting orders ready quickly. I noticed an attention to detail of theirs - there was an employee stationed in the midst of the people waiting for their orders. She was asking people if they had ordered already or not and was directing people appropriately. She asked me if I had ordered and since I did, I moved over to the order pick-up line. I appreciated the intention to create an as straightforward ordering experience as possible for customers. I will definitely be back!",5,1,4
Well just don't ask the server what's in the margaritas because she will tell you she's not a bartender. Also the pictures are enticing on line but lacks all the flavor. Highly don't recommend.,1,5,4
"I have nothing but positive things to say about this place. I walked out of Miller's Ale House twice this year because it did not have the Temple basketball game on ... and didn't have Comcast. Not only does Hooters HAVE Comcast, they will put the Temple basketball games on if you ask. Both times I walked in, asked the bartenders to put Temple on and they dropped everything and put the Owls on TV. First was Temple vs. Buffalo in December. The second game was Temple's win at UMASS in Feb. Both times the Flyers were on EVERY tv, but they asked me which one I wanted the Temple game on and I appreciated that. Also, the ending of the Temple vs. UMASS game was so exciting, a good portion of the Flyers' fans flocked over to the one TV to watch that ending. I might have converted a few hockey fans to college hoops that night. Needless to say, Miller's Ale House staff got not tip and Hooters girls got both a generous tip that I would have given them anyway and the tip that I was going to give to Miller's.",5,1,4
"We stopped in for four slices and the total was like 15 bucks, we didn't even finish the pizza. My father said it best when he described it as ""canival pizza.""

"Yes, it's good coffee, with a buy-10-get-1-free card. Cute place, great location. BUT. There's a huge BUT, guys. Strawberry Blonde Pony Tail dude- talk about poor service. I mean, you've just refinanced your mortgage so that you could afford those 10 coffees (but lykeomg you get a free one so it's worth it?...) and then Strawberry Blonde Pony Tail dude treats you like you're at the DMV. With one sustained glare into the floor, he manages to make the whole bougie coffee-buying experience a purgatory where hopes and dreams go to die. If you want some friendly service, or maybe just a vapid smile, try publicly executing a few small fluffy animals... The odds of experiencing smiles from a stranger will be resoundingly greater.",1,5,4
"My sister and I are both vegan and were excited to try the food here with all the good reviews. We got the bbq chicken, jerk chicken legs and pepper steak. We were really surprised how bad the fake meat was. The flavors and textures were so off we just threw everything away.",1,5,4
牛角真的是超级赞的一家烤肉店！！强烈推荐啊啊啊！我们这次3个人点了个两人份的套餐，但服务员非常贴心的rice，soup和甜点都配的三份，没有加钱。肉很鲜美入味，小菜也非常精致，最后的烤棉花糖也非常有趣。超级推荐！,5,1,4

OMG. My bf and I just moved to Manayunk from center city and asked a local bartender for a pizza suggestion. He overwhelmingly said Caputos and I ordered delivery as we were walking out of the bar. Less than 30 mins later I had a pepperoni and sweet sausage pizza I would do anything short of kill for. Do yourself a favor... Order pizza from Caputos.,5,1,4

"I loved this place. Went for a quick lunch and boy was it quick. We barely sat down when semeone approached for ordering. Drinks (a yummy vietanmease coffee) were delivered instantaneously. Without any exageration, the food was dilivered 1.5 minutes after we ordered. I was initially confused and thought they brought the food to wrong table. It looked and tasted like it was made to order! Very innexpensive and very tasty. Highly recommend for good vientamease!",5,1,4
"What better way to start the day than making a quick (parking not included) stop by @middlechildphiladelphia for a snacky snack. The Middle Child & that Breakfast Sandwich that's Arugula you see that's making the sandwich POP Awf and WHEW! Did it ever?! Now, if I would have stuck with my decision to add avocado. It would have been over for y'all! Their customer service was spot on. Whoever helped me with my order even asked me what I had planned for my day. Which kind of threw me a for a loop. Typically, people ask how you are for the day? They wished safe travels on the journey back to VA. Which was very thoughtful. The timeliness of the preparation wasn't bad either. It took about 10 minutes for my Breakfast Sandwich. Worth it!",5,1,4
"Basically if you're reading this, you're probably wondering if you should eat from Ekta or Tiffin. As far as chicken/lamb vindaloo goes, Ekta is the clear winner. Their vindaloo comes seething like molten lava, an evil red color born from the depths of hell. As I eat in my underpants, endorphins shoot through and I start to sweat upon my couch. That's what I'm talkin' about. Tiffin's is much milder and to me that's a no deal.",5,1,4

Customer service is really great! My duck meat came undone and I explained that I only eat well done meat. So the waiter apologized and took the plate to get it cooked. Staff came by to apologize as well and to offer me something. The plate came shortly and the meat was well done. It tasted great!,5,1,4
"There were no recent reviews and so i decided to put one in. I was there for my 21st and first ever trip to a strip club and it wasn't that crowded maybe because of the convention. The entry fee was decent 5 bucks, the bouncer was not rude, he asked everyone for id and voila we were in. After going in and taking seat at the bar we saw amazing girls performing. The girls also come to wherever you are sitting incase you don't know how to proceed or ask for a private dance. No pro tips here. Shout out to Nina! She was exceptionally amazing(1st lapdance).",5,1,4

"I went with my... pediatrician. lol. No, not my kid's doctor... MY pediatrician. lol. It was a lunchtime celebration of my 30th bday and her 30th anniversary seeing patients... I was one of her very first patients. :) I would review her, but as of this 30th anniversary, she is no longer seeing patients - a semi-retirement. So, me.. French restaurant.. ehhh, I wouldn't have chosen it, but sure. I'm game. I arrive around 10 minutes to 12 on a HORRIBLY rainy Tuesday and the place is virtually empty. I order my usual seltzer with lime, no ice, please and wait. Bartender Billy = A doll. Dr. Lady arrives almost immediately after me, and we are seated. Waiter Guy comes over - sans introduction - and says he must read us the specials. Neither of us got much of anything that he said. It was far too much and the delivery bored us to tears. Figs and artichokes and six other somethings piled onto a something else... uh.. no. He also called it the PRICE FIX menu. lol. I settled on the Salade Nicoise, after Doctor Lady points out that it might not actually be a Salade Nicoise since it is served with salmon. Waiter Guy completely missed the joke. Dr. Lady ordered the omelette. Food came mighty quickly - or maybe we just were too into our conversation to notice how long it took... whatever. She said her food was very good, and well, I am now completely enamored with the Nicoise. So, One star for decor... the place is beautiful... One star for bartender and hostess... One star for excellent food... One star for decent pricing... No star for waiter's personality. Sorry Waiter Guy. :(",4,1,3
"*UPDATE*: Yesterday Koto reached out to my friend and has apologized. They offered her a complimentary meal and were very nice! My friend and I ordered 5 rolls and some dumplings for delivery on her 30th birthday. An hour and a half later, called to find the food was still ""sitting at the restaurant"". They apparently use a 3rd party delivery service and do not actually employ the delivery drivers. Ended up canceling the order because the dumplings would have been cold and the sushi dried out and warm... and they still couldn't provide an ETA. They were rude and getting refunded was difficult. Unacceptable.",4,1,3
"Oh Gold Star. Late night hang out of Woodland Ave, West Philly's Crown Fried, always poppin on a weekend night. I really do love this place, and have tried almost everything on the menu- I've never been grossed out or gotten sick from anything, which I feel like is a success in our neighborhood. Now for the highlights: -basically all of the to-go sides taste home cooked and good, comfort food style. Fyi, the mashed potatoes come with chicken gravy instead of brown. -the platters are a really solid go-to- order that if it's your first time, especially the lamb platter over rice. It's delicious every time. -the same guy is almost always there, and really, really seems to care about what you think of the food. He is always gracious with criticism and warmly accepts compliments. Cons: -I've never had the pizza. It looks horrible. -I ordered a breakfast sandwich on a roll one time over the phone and they actually gave me scrambled eggs and cheese on a long hoagie roll. When I picked it up and looked shocked, the girl at the counter said ""A roll means a hoagie roll."" Fair, but who would want to eat 7 eggs on a hoagie roll for breakfast?! -They inexplicably have a $4 delivery charge. I live 1 block away and ordered delivery once when I was sick, and asked them if they were really going to charge me to deliver food 1 block. Yes, they were. Gold Star is not a place you would ever make a pilgrimage to. I would never go here if I didn't live in the neighborhood. But it's a true neighborhood joint, and if you're on Woodland and it's late and you want something better than McDonald's, Gold Star will be your drunken savior.",4,1,3
"Ever since the Philly Police installed a mini-station next to the serving counter, this McDonalds really cleaned up its act. Sure, the dining room and parking swarm with those huddled masses that didn't so much fall as joyously leapt off the wagon a long time past and retain little intention of climbing back aboard. So, you're still in fine company. In a corner booth sits Schizo engaged in lively conversation with his empty coffe cup. In a middle booth you'll find Shakey aiming that McDouble for her mouth but hitting her cbheek. Along side her, witness her buddy, Sleepy, nodding off and sweating, the poor fellow! But, the old gang aside, in comes the law and out goes the riff-raff. You won't be hassled for change while you eat, and the cleanliness no longer approximates an old movie house. Your feet no longer stick to the floor after you sit up from a booth. Each booth contains at least two fully sit-able seats. Granted, the food still retains its urban McDonalds ""flavor"" and the atmosphere may be characterized as ""questionable"". However, the Broad & Girard McDonalds witnessed a stunning historic event its suburban counterparts surely and jealously long for. In 1999, the Ol' Dirty Bastard, ever the rascal, escaped from court-ordered drug rehabilitation and fled as a fugitive from the law. An always vigilant Philly police officer recognized him, ran the license of his Jersey car idling at the drive-through window, and the rest is, as they say, history. Let's have a mural!",5,2,3
"This is a great little BYOB, with fantastic pizza. My friends both enjoyed their pasta dinners, I had the eggplant parm which was A-OK but not the best I've ever had. The breadsticks and marinara sauce are a reason to return on their own! Fresh and served hot. Additionally, the ambiance was so much fun. There was an older italian man playing music and singing, it reminded me of south philly! However, my 4 star rating is for the FOOD only. They kicked us, and 2 other full tables, out of the restaurant 15 mins after closing! We didn't even get to finish the last of our wine. I understand everyone wants to go home - I waitressed for many years and never in my life has that EVER been acceptable to ask a table to leave, especially only 15 mins after closing time, and then to make it worse and blame it on the owner? Come on! That's no way to run a business and get return customers. I'm sure I'll be back here at some point, only because I live a couple blocks away, BUT next time I'll be sure it's nowhere near closing time because apparently you're not welcome here even 1 min later than that.",4,1,3
"Ehh not as good as our experience int he Italian Market. Partly my fault for ordering dishes with loads of peppers, that's all you could taste. The chorizo and roasted poblano was non-existent in the immortal soul. The consistency of the Liz lemon was odd dry,grainy but also mushed with the topping, general lack of flavor other than peppers. The toofer one stuffed French toast- challah french toast stuffed with a sweet blend on cream cheese, walnut, strawberry, chocolate, peanut butter Liz lemon eat your family breakfast-grilled pear oatmeal cornbread topped with egg whites scrambled with BBQ molasses chicken, pepper jack cheese, roasted corn and tri-bell peppers, finished with pinto bean gravy.

"I don't know another late night happy hour like this around town. You order drink after sophisticated drink and suddenly, though your legs develop cocktail bruises, your wallet doesn't. Before you know it, you've bought drinks for many other bar patrons and your bill doesn't exceed twenty one dollars. Am I just really charming or is this place just -that- special? It's that special, and my charisma merely won me smiles from the bartender, not any special discounts. $3 drafts and half off specialty cocktails. If you appreciate an aesthetically pleasing ambiance with in-the-know folks, go here on a Tuesday night between 9 and 11 when Meghan is behind the bar. Most likely, you won't be sorry.",5,2,3
"Indeed, this Iron Chef restaurant did not disappoint. Originally seated at a booth, we noticed there were seats at the sushi bar so we asked to switch. Afterall, what's the point of going to a famed restaurant if you can't see the chefs at work - it's like your own kabuki theater. It's better to just order the $80 omakase because this is one restaurant where you'll find it difficult to share. The meal was well-balanced and never left us with a greasy or oily aftertaste. Flavors and textures were novel and foreign. Some dishes (like the tuna tartar) were difficult to compare because there were no prior reference points. Renewed my faith in sushi.

"I had already committed to patronizing this local spot: The burger was solid, the beer was cold and the place was clean. I'm just not a big fan of businesses displaying their social views, (whether I'm with them or not) it's stupid. One and done for my crew.",1,4,3
"Philly was a pleasure to visit a beautiful city, I was Lil disappointed with the food, Bread was not warm, meat was not the best quality, small place, So if you are in a big group this may not be the place for you. Was not worth the $$$$ Philly is known for the best Philly Cheesesteaks sorry but Campos did not deliver that! Maybe it was due to being very very busy. It was Cash Only and not an ATM on-site so that was also an inconvenience.",2,5,3
"This place was actually a good surprise. Despite a terrible first encounter with a really rude hostess who gave away our table and lied about a wait time (that ended up being over an hour) and refused to give us an open table that had been cleaned for 20 minutes, the manager went above and beyond to improve our experience. Our server Christian was fantastic and attentive. The food was actually SO GOOD! A few of us went for the ""survivor menu"" where you cook the protein yourself on a steaming rock. It was a cool concept and the meat and fish were really fresh. Overall I recommend for the food alone, regardless if you're into the Mad Max theme.",4,1,3

"I really enjoyed the PMoA this weekend! I loved the old architecture in the building. I've never been to a museum that brought old architecture into the museum, but I was so very impressed. The European cathedral style work and the gothic era room were my favorite! Of the art pieces, a piece called ""Birthday"" resignation with me and I just needed a poster of it. I went to the 1st floor gift shop to purchase one. The worker said they would have it on the main floor, however she checked her own store first for me. I walked to the lower floor to look for the poster, excited to have such a unique new piece for my collection. I made eye contact with a worker, who proceeded to literally run from me. I am heavily tattooed, and was with a friend who had similar ""abrasive"" qualities. I finally tracked down this worker and asked for her help, (in which I could tell she didn't want to help me), and was told ""well didn't you look here yourself?"" After explaining my want for this particular poster. (She was looking in the prints, and by this time by friend found the poster for me). I was a bit taken a back, as this is an ART museum, and tattoos are much an art form in themselves. This was my and my friends first time in this city or museum, and this was the first and only ""negative"" reaction we encountered, so unfortunately it did stick. Beautiful museum, amazing sick for the price. I do hope to make another trip out sometime soon!",4,1,3
"I wanted to be sure I came back here and gave credit where it was due. After having some subpar service (but great food) - the manager reached out to me and offered to have us back. I never got back to him for a variety of reasons, but mostly because I did not want him to feel we were looking for a ""free meal"". In that spirit, my wife and I went back several times (different days of the week, times) and I have to tell you - superb! Service has been A-1, and the food continues its constant quality. Tonight my wife and I went and it sealed the deal for me to update this review. Very sweet and attentive waitress and great service all around. There was an unfortunate incident with a dropped plate from another table that shattered next to/under ours. No less than 4 staff members checked FIRST to make sure we were ok. They offered to remake our meals at least three times (which wasn't needed as all was well) - and offered us a free desert for the overall hassle (which we did not feel any hassle at all). If you are in the area, this Diner is a must. The staff have got it together, management is pleasant and on top of things - and I can't say enough good things about the food. Faith restored in the Oregon Diner!",5,2,3
I am changing my original review since I have received a nice message from the owner of the Oregon diner. There was never any issue of the quality to the food I had ever received from the Diner. It was the issue of the service I had received on New Years Eve. The nice message that I received from the owner shows that management here really cares about their customers even after the bad service my family & I had received on New Years Eve.,4,1,3
"Pats and Genos are both for toruists. Real cheesesteaks dont have cheese wiz and are loaded with meat. A step up is Johns Pork or Tony Lukes.

With approximately 148 amazing Mexican restaurants in philly, Tequilas isn't one. (148 is made up) but you get my point.",2,5,3
"New management. Total disaster at first. Kitchen closed for a week or two. Memo and dry goods drastically reduced. I'd try occasionally until we see if they regain their strength. An excellent neighborhood deli. Full range of breakfast options. The usual eggs, meats and breads and some specials. Hoagies and cheesesteaks for lunch. All the junk food you could want such as chips and cookies. Large beer selection including drafts.",2,5,3
Went in a 9:00 on a Sunday where there was no wait. Ordered two dozen (1 doz fancy and 1 doz hot) for a party at 3:00. Of course it was only after I paid and was walking out that I asked if the hots would hold up until for six hours. I couldn't follow the instruction to pop in a hot oven right before serving since I didn't have a hot oven at the party BUT I can attest to the fact that they held up just fine and were delicious and were practically inhaled on the spot. We had at least three of every flavor and each was equally loved by all. Thanks for making me the star of the party!,4,1,3
"Went to Amada Saturday for about the fifth time. Garces is an extraordinary chef and to keep a place that big humming the way it does while keeping the food quality so high is the mark of an excellent manager also. Had a lovely time as always, sharing the food among the four of us is always a lot of fun. Our waiter was charming, enthusiastic and knowledgeable, pushing the food but in a gentle way. After about 15 dishes, we remembered that we hadn't received our cheese plate, we decided that we were quite full and asked the waiter to cancel it. Here's where Dr. Jekyll became Mr. Hyde, or is it the other way round? He said cancel it? What am I going to do with it? OK he said, I'll just have the chef throw it in the garbage. I couldn't believe my ears. First I answered, if you have a chef who will throw away a cheese plate, he needs to be fired. And secondly, with over 200 guests ordering, if you can't sell that dish within the next 20 minutes it needs to be taken off the menu.. I further explained that if it had been a hot dish we would have accepted it. I'll certainly go back again, chalking off an amusing encounter as simply a hardcore professional Old City waiter protecting his tip. I'll even return despite the hostess coming over to ask how we were, putting her hand over 6 empty sugar packets and moving them closer to the edge of the table? and never removing them. These things are all part of the fun of dining in the big city. I love it.",4,1,3
"We ate at Suga about a month ago. I loved my waiter, my lemon drop Martini and my delicious meal. I could not wait to return . My husband set up a Mothers day dinner. We got there right on time and walked with the hostess through the restaurant, down a step into a small room with zero atmosphere and two large industrial size vacuums set up behind my seat. Are you kidding me? Felt as though I was in a broom closet. They then moved us next to a loud little boy. There were lots of other tables., But I was told that they are very booked up for that day. I won't go back. I got a terrific seat and delicious meal at Vernicks.",1,4,3
"Made the Sunday trip from Jersey just for the Cafe', was not disappointed. Had a bowl, some soup and Black tea. Had to take a to go bag the portion was so large.

"Sooooooooo ghetto. It really annoys me to call this place. ""Oh ARD, ya order be $17.50"" But don't let that ruin your Pizza Hut experience. The food takes about an hour to come via delivery, and they--for the most part--get your order right. Although your pizza may be a little cold when it comes. I always get a little craving for the breadsticks, and so does my friend, which is why I patronize this place every month They serve the Oak Lanes and Germantown, which is why the orders take forever to come.",4,1,3
"Recommend the Spaghetti Aglio e Olio.........on the bland side but once you add salt and grated cheese to your liking, phenomenal! And, the spaghetti is always done perfectly al dente. Shrimp Parmiagiana.........you can smell the wine in the sauce..........great! Did NOT like the baked ziti......ricotta cheese mixed throughout and it looked like a big old mess.........not tasty either. Did not like their roasted pepper appetizer..........it would be a lot better if it were not SO DARN SALTY!!!!!!!!! Also don't like the fact that this place does not offer any salad dressing............you are stuck with plain old vinegar and olive oil. The bread, however, is FABULOUS!!!!!!!!!!!",4,1,3
The spicy sausage pizza was off the charts! I only wish I would have dined in as it was cold by the time I got all the way back to The Marriott. They need to invest in larger to go cups.,4,1,3

Trestle carves their niche as a literally stripped down resurrection of the former J&J Trestle Inn, which did the lord's work by serving such delicacies as the Fat P***y cocktail and posted signs to proffer you need not bring in your weapons. Raw, unadorned walls give the impression Bubbles from The Wire used to hole up here for several heroin-fueled days at a time. Personified, this place is the Black Keys before people like me heard of them. Maybe better yet, Trestle is a mostly recovered meth head. You still wouldn't lend them money. The crack head chic decor is spread across two rooms. In one you'll move to beats that haven't been touched by Diddy, Flo Rida, or anyone interviewed by Ryan Seacrest. In the other you'll sit and drink up the courage to dance with someone on that elusive other side. In both you'll stare at go-go dancers tastefully shaking that ass. Tip 'em if you do. The beer list is strong, but it's strong every where in Philadelphia. Drink whiskey here. If you're not drinking a whiskey sour ($8), that's fine, but you're missing out on the camaraderie. Bucking its role as the wife beater of drinks, there's almost a working class hero feel to the way they do it justice. The acidity is mellowed by the frothy egg white, which lays on top like a blanket of snow on a double wide trailer, making the inherent sour bite more fetish nibble than vampire wound that store-bought mixes lay on you. It's suspiciously refreshing for a whiskey drink. And, because your friend will ask, the bird isn't real.",5,2,3
"Service was great, escargot and dessert were excellent. Salad poor. Champagne by the glass at $25 was rip off and sneaky.",2,5,3
"Last time here was 5 years ago . The volume of steak they give you is plentiful for 2 steak sandwiches at other places . The pierces of steak meat was moist with a good amount of chew . Sesame roll makes this cheesesteak stands out from the rest , not to soft and not to chewy. Steak is cook when order and not sitting pile up staying warm waiting for customer to order . Differently top 5 cheesesteak in Philly .",4,1,3
"BAD AÇAÍ BOWL: I like the restaurant usually, but I did not like my experience with the açaí bowl. It was literally like a millimeter or açaí and was I completely still hungry. Luckily my friends are skinny, so I got to have the bread of their sandwiches. It was unacceptable for an entre. Disappointed",4,1,3
"Sometimes I like to take friends and family who have never been and get one from Pat's and one from here and see which they like best. It's fun, just don't forget and take a steak over to the other area, you'll get boo'd out of the place!",2,5,3
Princess and I went here and had olive plate and bone marro plate as appetizers and then we had the skirt steak and the octopus plates ... Nothing was left uneaten ...,4,1,3
"Considering the decor and cuisine, it's good value for your money. And the staff aren't annoyingly stuck up, so that's even better. Basically, it's a trendy restaurant serving interesting cuisine without the attitude.",5,2,3
Mad River would be my idea of hell if hell had a bar in it (which it probably does and Satan only serves Bud Light and shots of Jager). Components to a hellish bar: 1) Scantily clad Old city hos and playas grinding on the dance floor 2) Pop music from the 80s and 90s 3) Overpriced and very crappy beer 4) Obnoxious dudes who think buying a drink for a girl equals getting some 5) An address in Old City The only reason I even went is because one of my girls knew the bartender and we were drinking free Jameson. I don't think I'd go back even for more free whiskey. Well maybe.,1,4,3
Came to Philly and can't leave without trying a Philly cheesesteak sandwich. Read the reviews for Cleaver and I was disappointed with the food. I was wondering what happen to the cheese..can't have a philly cheeseSteak without the cheese. Now I have to look for another spot to satisfied the craving.,2,5,3
"The service is great. The food is good, except for the French fries. They are really bad. They were literally the worst I've had- almost none of them were longer then 2 inches, most were one inch. I actually had to laugh when I saw them. And they didn't make up for their appearance in taste. I would never order them again - instead I would swap them out for the homemade tater tots (as my friend had - and they were really good).",4,1,3
"I'm all about finding new places for quizzo, so I came here for that specific reason - for the 9pm quizzo. I got there at like 8:58 and the hostess said all the tables were full and she suggested we might as well leave because everyone was there for quizzo. I wasn't about to leave so I asked if it's cool if we go to the bar. She seemed puzzled that anyone would ever want to do that, and I was puzzled that a hostess would ever suggest customers leave. Anyway, the bar's good, they have a lot of different beer, and when I knocked over my friend's beer (I hadn't even started drinking yet) the bartender kindly replaced his beer. The quizzo was really cool. They put the questions up on the TV so if you can't hear well, or if English isn't your first language (or both), you can just read the question at your own pace. The questions weren't impossible, so that's nice too!",4,1,3
"The service, including the hostess, was great all around. A lot of restaurants ask you how you would like your burger cooked and then bring it to you medium-well, regardless of what you asked for. That is not the case a Con Murphy's. The burger was cooked perfectly. Just as importantly, the bacon on the burger was cooked perfectly. The fries were great. If there was some malt vinegar aioli on the side, it would have made my afternoon. However, I was left with just ketchup, horrible, disgusting ketchup. Don't get me wrong, I love ketchup. I'm not picky either, Heinz, Huntz, Del Monte, grocery store, whatever. I just do not ever want that nasty generic restaurant bulk ketchup that tastes like a mix of random chemicals. I'll never understand why restaurants take such pride in making great food and then put something so awful next to it. I guess most chef's are just anti-ketchup and put whatever cheap crap they can out for the stupid customers that always ask for it.",4,1,3
"A stupid ex-bf introduced me to David's many moons ago, and even though I have many horrible memories of going there with his Chinese family, I somehow manage to stow away those memories deep into the depths of my brain, and head to David's for my usual dishes of salt & pepper squid, beef chow fun, and dumplings with the ridiculous ginger scallion sauce. That ginger scallion sauce is magic: it heals all wounds AND makes the stomach very, very happy.",4,1,3
"The Bartender Brian was a complete sweetheart! He made sure to engage in a conversation with my friend and I. We weren't sure what to drink and he made great suggestions. Our drink was delicious. But Brian was the only one attending to us and other customers. He was running around back and forth attending everyone while I overheard that the manager was outside. When he asked for help (twice) the response was ""help with what"" and ""can you do it"" instead of ""I'll be right with you"". He had so many things on his plate while the manager sat outside with friends. I found it completely unprofessional and unthoughtful. Brian was great and if it wasn't for him I don't know if my experience would've been the same.",4,1,3
"Went here Friday night with a group of 5 to celebrate a birthday. We had high expectations for this place because it came highly recommended and because the reviews were amazing. We were all SO disappointed with the food. I will say that their bartenders make amazing drinks, we got an off the menu mango mojito which was exceptional. Got the: Lechon Asado Vaca Frita Chicken imperial Arroz Pegao Pineapple guacamole The guacamole and the drinks were about the only good things that came out of this. I personally ate the arroz pegao and it tasted like the rice was soaked in oil for about 30 mins before being served. I also tried some of the chicken and it was dry as a bone and tasted like 3 week old meat. This was probably one of the most disappointing meals i've had in Philly. The food is just sub-par and more for show than anything else.",2,5,3
"Order the Tasting menu, food & wine, & bring your appetite! From the Green Beans to the Paella, this place gets it right. The one thing that they need to improve is a better explanation on the paired wine. The waiter just poured, told us the name, & walked away. Other than that the food rocked!",4,1,3
"I love honeygrow don't get me wrong, but there is definitely room for improvement at this location. The food has been consistently good so they definitely have the kitchen system down when it comes to making correct orders! The lunch rush is hectic and I totally sympathize but they seem to be making it harder on themselves. For starters, the music is so ridiculously loud that you can not hear your number from any table or even standing by the drinks area. With 10-15 people waiting for food its not like you can guess when your order will be ready. Recently I ended up waiting an extra 10 minutes because I didn't hear my number and it was never repeated. Once I heard numbers 5 above my order number I decided to investigate and found my order sitting there on the counter. Just be prepared to wait, and fight a crowd to try to see if your order is getting cold on the counter. **Apparently they do have a screen but this was my first visit so I had no clue and since you use a computer to order, no one directs you to look at the screen.",4,1,3
"Where Philly gets real. The only question is, how real do you want it ...",2,5,3
"Looks like an everyday normal diner from the outside, but food is actually higher quality than what you would think this diner would offer. Friendly servers, not-watered down coffee, and clean plates.",4,1,3
"When I actually lived in Philly, I never ate at Marathon Grill. I must have been smarter back then. Or maybe it was just because I had my own kitchen. As an out-of-town visitor, I've tried it twice (10th and Walnut and the Chestnut St location), both times on a weekday morning on my way out of town. Both times the food hasn't lived up to the menu and has left me with regrets. On the most recent visit, which, I swear, will be the last, my croque monsieur was cold and my coffee sat empty. But in both cases, I have to admit, the restaurant provided a nice, nearby, Center City brunchy-breakfast destination that got me on my way in good time. But convenience isn't all that yummy.",2,5,3
"I love a great Philly cheese steak. Not a fan of this one. Not the proper cheese steak roll. If your from Philadelphia you know it's all about the roll. And forget the cheese sauce, awful. May be ok if ordered with provolone. Best bet just get the fries, they are good dipped in ketchup. Service was good and speedy just what you need in an airport.",2,5,3
I've been going to this place for over ten years. The owner is so sweet. It's always packed!!! We have waited for a while on the ramp with no one saying anything. We had a reservation and still waited thirty minutes. The service can be a bit slow sometimes that is why I took a star off. They should have someone to regularly come by and fill waters and tea. Food is consistent and yummy! I never leave here hungry that's for sure!,4,1,3
"Reviewer ""Elite 10"" must have been at a different place. For him to describe this steak as dry, just confused me. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Juicy steak, Provlone, and what tastes like ""right out of the oven"" bread add up to a good reason to gain ten pounds. It's just delicious.",5,2,3
"I will not eat pound cake from anywhere else, ever. Wish it was in a better area but well worth the drive!",4,1,3
"Uh oh, Nom Nom you have a death wish if you think you're going to sustain yourself with these astronomical prices. Remember you're in a food court in West Philly, not a boutique in upper east side. $14 for a bowl of what is, by Japanese tradition, a cheap and easy food is a slap in the face.",2,5,3
"Adore the sushi here! Been going to them before the name change and has eaten there after the ownership changed, same quality of food. Have not been disappointed",4,1,3
"Just about edible. I live in Philly and am born and raised and I have had a better steak sandwich in a neighborhood place which doesn't claim to be the ""best"".",2,5,3
"Where is the chef? In the basement??? Yes, I am a sushi snob. Would love to see the chef out in front.",2,5,3
"My friends and I posted up for a few hours yesterday very excited to check out the post. We were celebrating after finishing final exams for our graduate program. We had a lovely time, enjoyed the food, and had great beer throughout the afternoon and evening. Our bartender was lovely. However, I was very, very disappointed by how the manager (not going to state his name although definitely should) treated a confusion regarding a friend swinging back through with her service dog. He was inappropriate, unkind, and treated OTHER patrons to a drink for the inconvenience of his reaction rather than dealing with improving his customer service with us. I will be back, but am very disappointed that patrons who spent $150+ would not receive some kind of apology for such treatment. Other patrons commented on how rude he was to us.",4,1,3
Open 24h. Get the creamed chipped beef with two dippy eggs (only after midnight). Waitress was very charming,4,1,3
"I've been here a few times to get coffee to go - and here for hours doing work. hand poured coffee - wow. its so good!! why can't my bodum coffee taste like this? cucumber water - self serve. free. i like. wifi - free. i like. the smell - does not smell like burnt coffee/strong coffee like many coffee houses do. it smells quite pleasant actually!! sandwich - i don't like. i got the fig/apple on baguette. i've never received a $7 sandwich so tiny. length - 4 inches. i was wondering where the other half was. did they run low on bread? it left me still hungry and wanting more to eat. tiniest sandwich ever. there's bar seating w/ outlets below, a few small tables, then 2 big worktables w/ benches. it got pretty crowded one monday morning. i will def be back for the coffee, free wifi and cucumber water - but not the sandwiches!",4,1,3
"I fall in love with this place at first sight. The food was good, the service great, and even the bathroom was wonderful. This small restaurant feels very authentic and make you think as if you are in Mexico. They are not to eager to provide the free item listed on the Yelp coupon plus no credit or debit payment, which is why they get 2 instead of 5 stars.",2,5,3
"Stayed here during our first trip to Philly and this hotel is definitely all about location. To, literally, everything! While it's clean, gigantic, up-to-date, and the staff was extremely friendly, it lost one star for one thing: on our first night we asked the front desk for wine glasses and were told they'd be sent right-up--three calls, no apologies, and over an hour later, the glasses finally arrived. Why not let us grab the glasses from the bar downstairs (10 steps away) when we were initially requesting them if that was going to be such a hassle?",4,1,3
"Food and beer was great. Our server Justin was great. Management however was terrible. We noticed quite a few times that while the servers were running around and working hard, the manager was on his phone. I work at a restaurant and have management that is always helpful on the floor. When the restaurant is busy, it should be management's responsibility to support the staff, especially during such tough times in the service industry. And that was not the case here.",4,1,3
"Pho ga or chicken pho. What about it? It's authentic here. It should have a light color, the pilsner to the bock of pho bo. It should taste of the lighter coriander instead of anise and clove. It comes with chopped chicken with the bone, a by product of making the stock with only whole stewing hens. The chicken meat robust and slightly chewy. If your Pho shop doesn't meet the required needs above for Pho gà, what other items might not be authentic?",4,1,3
"The guy at the front desk was horrible and not friendly whatsoever, extremely rude. The asian guy (I think his name is Daniel) who was actually with us during axe throwing was awesome and the 4 stars are for him and his service. This place needs more employees like him that actually make the experience a good time rather than having the monotone, rude, probably high dude in the front. Will probably be back once restrictions aren't as limited, it was hot in there and the bar was closed.",4,1,3
"Pigeons won't starve for food, but patrons will starve for attention and hospitality at this establishment. What a shame too. The food was good. I had the warm lentils over greens with a think slice of rye bread and poached eggs done to perfection. The pastries looked delicious. The setting that included tables as well as countertop dining was right up my alley. And the one, drip coffee option was a smooth medium roast that did not disappoint. But the staff left me and my guest feeling less them welcomed and no desire to return.",2,5,3
"Noodle, they are industrialized Noodle and not a daily made product. Egg, it's like the best soft boiled since yolk is half harden. Broth, not flavorful for ramen Broth and no mixing whatsoever. Can't believe this is second chain already in Philly. Don't recommend foodie to go. Time to level up ramen choice if you want something better.",2,5,3
"I came down specially to eat here from Bucks County. I've eaten there before love it ..order drinks at the bar. My craft beer came out perfect The margaritas were 5% tequila and 95% lime juice . The cocktail was Undrinkable... left and went somewhere else, had a great time!",2,5,3
"This Applebee's is so convenient right at Henry and ridge ave. All Applebee's taste the same, but this one has a very friendly staff and the restaurant is generally clean",4,1,3
"I ordered GrubHub at approximately 11:30 pm and received my food at 12:30 am. I ordered Crab Rangoon (delicious), KimChi (could have been bigger for the price-was served in a half-pint container for $4), Vegetable and Bean curd soup-pint (delicious), and Ma Po Tofu, also delicious. I read previous reviews before ordering this food, and am a regular when it comes to eating Asian food throughout the city... and I check Yelp a lot before I go somewhere. Just like Henry P. said.. I'm glad I didn't listen to the Yelp users that only use Yelp to review businesses on a negative level-you know, the ones who expect to be treated like they're eating at a five star restaurant and expect to get that tier of food delivered and pay $12 to do so. Wake up. Delivery came on time, and the price was right. I'll order again.",4,1,3
"HUGE slices of pizza and it doesn't taste like a rubber. If you haven't had a slice of pizza that takes up the entire pizza box, then you have to stop by here. Definitely a good way to soak up all that alcohol after a night out on South Street or wherever you have gotten your fix!",4,1,3
If you're looking for a good quality cheese steak it's at Sonny's! Good service and not expensive at all!,5,2,3
I can remember when Joey experimented with the cheap cheese cr*ps uses across the street. I said to Joey I'd gladly pay more for kraft cheese. The comment was dismissed so I decided no more Wizz and after 1 year of no Wizz fries kraft was back. Now Geno I beg you please stop serving that meat. Go over to Joe's aka (chinks) and taste the product. It is by far the best cheesesteak I've had to date. Make geno's what it once was the best cheesesteak in Philly,2,5,3
This is a pizza landmark on Frankford Ave for many many years.....nothing has changed.......they are probably the oldest business on that part of the ave.......same owner.....same recipe. ....that tells you something.....,4,1,3
"I didn't really know it was a British gastropub. A friend invited me for lunch. I climbed many stairs. I ordered an iced tea with simple syrup. It was so bitter. I sent it back and ordered a watery glass of Rose, there was only one choice. I had the house salad, swimming in a lemony dressing. Had to ask for bread, salt. Service was accommodating, generally. I was happy to see my friend & wI'll not bother to return to Dandelion.",1,4,3
"Great spot to people watch and enjoy a bottle of wine and maybe and appetizer but if you are hungry and looking for an authentic French Bistro.... Go somewhere else. I have given this place 4 chances for the kitchen to impress me and it's been a disappointment every time. The food lacks flavor! I have tried, Steak, Sandwiches, Salads, and Fish and everything seemed to be very bland. I will give the escargot a 10 but 9.5 points of that score comes from the massive amount of butter used in the sauce. Anything floating in butter is delicious! I believe this is my least favorite Steven Starr production. The service is always friendly and professional..",2,5,3
"Like Wawa, but with much better food and an ATM that costs money. Just had a vegetarian chicken hoagie from Palm Tree Market and it was way good.",5,2,3
this gearo's closed...they only have the one on welsh road. welsh road one isn't doing so well either,4,1,3
"this place is oozing history, from the rat pack to joe dimaggio and including but not limited to guests such as, lillian russell, bob hope and richard nixon they have all came and left their mark. It hosted presidents, local politicians, countless international dignitaries and celebrities. In the 1950s and 1960s, devotees of its famous five-pound lobsters included elizabeth taylor and many many others. In later years, bookbinder's continued to attract a celebrated following including david bowie, madonna, and muhammad ali. bookbinders is a philadelphia landmark, that i basically never go to. so uhm yea.",4,1,3
The jerk wings/sauce and chicken foot soup are great when they have it. They never keep it regularly.,2,5,3
"I bought a $50 groupon for Kokopelli on a friend's recommendation and was anxious to try it out. My boyfriend and I went there on Saturday night before a concert and ordered 5 plates between the two of us. Honestly, nothing was good. And a few things were really bad. The bison sliders were inedible. The shrimp wasn't far behind...and I LOVE food and usually can find positives at most places. The atmosphere is nice, waitress was very pleasant...but they really need to step up their kitchen or they will be out of business quite soon with all the amazing other options available to us in this amazing food-filled city.",2,5,3
"Two things: We love Tim. Tim is the best bartender. We met Tim when he was just a server, then a bar back, and now he's our favorite bartender. Give him a raise. But....the bald guy! He's the worst. He's got a smug attitude and his customer service sucks. One time when serving us, his reply to how he was doing was, ""You know, I'm at work."" Hmm... get a new job then. Tonight, while sitting at the bar I heard him say ""cheap asses"" as he looked at the tip that was left him on a tab. It's probably cause you're not a personable guy!",4,1,3
"My husband and I were serviced 12-27-15. Our sever (Edward M), appeared to be overwhelmed with his tables he was responsible for. He served the table on my right and left, but didn't acknowledge us right away. Five minutes later, he asked us for a drink order. We ordered. My Husband also mentioned, we didn't have saucers for our loaf of bread. He came back with 2 saucers to accommodate us. Our dinner was very tasty. Although he forgot my vegetable, I waited and caught him at another table to tell him. He served us hastily. ÇF was good, but waiter was so so.",4,1,3
"What can I say, Naked Chocolate Cafe is delish! I was in need of cupcakes for a birthday party recently and not sure where to acquire them. I visited Yelp! and found tons of rave reviews of this place. Everyone was right on. A word to the wise: don't show up on a Saturday morning and order a dozen cupcakes unless you're ready for the snarky guy behind the counter to inform you that bulk orders need to be made 24 hours in advance. Would you believe this happened to me? Fortunately he was able to fill the order and my fellow party-goers were quite happy.",4,1,3
"Me: ""Where's your favorite place to eat here?"" Philly Native: ""Have you had a cheesesteak yet?"" Me: ""(Sigh) I had Pat's and Geno's. Wasn't impressed.""

""Oh yeah."" Sorry, Philly cheesesteaks. After three strikes, yer out.",2,5,3
"Not sure why this place gets such rave reviews or always has such an extensive wait (constantly crowding the sidewalk). Service has always been fine (I've only been at ""off-peak"" weekday hours with no wait). Food is mediocre - at best. There are plenty of other places in the neighborhood to get a great brunch without the wait.",2,5,3
"I sit in my car on a Fairmount side street. I was worried about parking, but found an ok place near 27th st. I hadnt gone bar hopping in decades, frankly, even when I was young and pretty, I didnt really do it all that much. But here i was today. I was to meet a few friends to check out a few of the local bars. I took my cellphone, car keys, and grabbed my Costanza-like wallet. "" Do I really need this? "" I thought I decided to just take my money and credit card, and that I probably wouldnt need my Acme card for this. I lingered over my license, wondering if I would need it. I chuckled to myself. Ive been going grey since 19. In pictures I often look older than my dad. Even with a little help from JFM (Just for Men) I NEVER get carded. So in the first of what would be a series of bad decisions over the night, I left my ID in the car. North Star wasnt the first bar we hit that night, but we werent drunk when we got there. It looked like a cool place from the outside. A couple of tricked out Harleys stood out front. I wondered what kind of crowd was in there and if they would see my flame colored hawaiian shirt as a cry for help. A large intimidatig black man was leaning on a mailbox, talking animatedly on a Bluetooth. His bass-like voice filled the quiet street. I was not savy enough to realize that this was a bouncer. We dont have bouncers in the Burbs. We went to walk in. "" Excuse me Gentlemen! Can I see your ID?"" he bellowed He couldnt mean me. My friends showed their IDs and began to walk in. I was realizing that I had made a huge mistake by not bringing ID "" Hey guys!"" I mumbled, "" I dont have my ID"" The bouncer still stood there but was back into his phone conversation. one of my friends turned around and told me to come anyway, as he couldnt have meant for my old ass to show ID. I began to walk in until I felt a hand on my shoulder. "" Hey!"" , he said sharply, "" were you just going to go in and ignore me!"" My mind raced. Was I going to get my ass kicked? Was I going to run away? Was I going to make a smart-ass comment that would increse my chances of getting my ass kicked? I optioned for being apologetic.I realized that this guy knew i was of age but it was his territory and he ruled over it. I also realized that he wanted to F* with me. He admonished me, told me to bring my ID next time and told me I could go in. Inside, it looked like a really cool dive bar. We stayed in the front bar. Apparently there is a back bar with a stage for live music. There was a concert going on but we werent interested, and to avoid paying a cover, we opted to stay in the front. We got a table with extremely uncomfortable stools. The crowd was diverse, the good , the bad and the tattooed. I guess the band playing dictates the crowd, a lot of black clothing alot of tattoos. My friend bought me a beer to make up for almost getting me killed by the bouncer, so I didnt deal with the bartender. They looked the part, and i noticed there was a computer with Youtube on it behind the bar. I wondered the signifigance of that. I had a Guiness to clear the pallate after the Belgian beers we had earlier. I was hungry, and I heard that the burgers were good here. There was a chalkboard advertizing an Olympic Burger, which was basically a souped up cheeseburger served with onion rings instead of fries. (get it! ? Olympic rings) I wanted it. Plus I heard somewhere to always try the special when you go to a new place and may not go again. We called a waitress over and I adored her from the moment she tripped over my friend's bodybag-like backpack. She was cute and friendly and even though she was really busy, gave us her time and didnt rush away. It was loud in there but not so loud that we couldnt have a conversation. Plus , we could hear the music from the concert without having to pay. Suckers! I didnt get the same vibe as in Bridgids, about interacting with other patrons. Everyone basically stayed in their own group. My burger was fantastic. Ill have to go back sometime when i hadnt had 4 beers so i can really enjoy it. The waitress checked on us often. This is not something im used to in the burb bars that are often less busy.It was time to go. As we walked out I passed my friend, the bouncer. He shouted in my direction, "" Whats the score!?"" I stopped. He said the same thing 2 more times. It wouldnt be wise to ignore him again , but what score? Phillies? Eagles? Me vs Him ( hes winning 1-0) I turned and said, ""which score?"" He looked at me like an idiot. Of course. the Bluetooth again, i HATE those things. He wasnt talking to me. Why does every outing end with me looking like an ass. Overall I gave it 4stars. I didnt really take any points off for either Bouncer incident, as it was mostly my fault and he was just doing his job. It was a cool place with good food and good service.",4,1,3
I am a regular. I love this place. I am very close to making another choice. The food has gone way down in the past couple of months. Even the go tos food classic like wings taste off. A lot of food taste frozen. A lot of burgers and fries are inconsistent. It is is breaking my heart. The owner has been observed yelling at this staff one too many times. It is so uncomfortable. The staff is the MAIN reason why we (and many) others come. I am worried...I hope that this gets their attention to bring in quality ingredients and cooks ASAP!,2,5,3
The meat is complete and juicy. You have the options of cheeses and if you want to be disrespectful and go non traditional they got options as well. The parking is a bust but does not deter us from the specialty food!,4,1,3
"The food was okay, but the service is terrible. The waiter took 15 minutes till he asked us what we wanted to order even though we were the only customers present, forgot the order after three seconds, and took our plates away before we finished our food.",4,1,3
I invariably get pad thai at every thai place I go. I just love it when it is good. This was one of the more disappointing ones I've had in the city.,2,5,3
"2 beers + 1 sardine* order = $7.66 No my math is not wrong and no I am not crazy. You are crazy! Crazy for not going to ASB's happy hour every day (M-F 4-6, Sa & Su 11-1). Half priced cans. Half priced selection of food. Ahhhmazing. *If you are like me, you think sardines are teeny teeny tiny. You are wrong. ASB is the land of huge sardines. No, not like tuna fish huge, but like sardines on steroids huge. Who knew???",4,1,3
"After reading some reviews on here about service, I'm wondering how many went through a delivery service site like GrubHub or Seamless. I placed an order tonight through Seamless, and THEY were the ones who messed up. Before I even received a confirmation from Seamless, I received a call from Manny's telling me that they were out a veal parm and asked if chicken would be fine. After that call, I received my confirmation email from Seamless. Seven minutes later, I received another from Seamless telling me that my order was NOT confirmed and that they are refunding my order. I called Manny's back, and, sure enough, my order was about to leave the door. I called Seamless to let them know that everything was fine, and they had to call Manny's AGAIN for a confirmation, which they promptly received. When my order arrived (extremely promptly, by the way), I gave the delivery person an extra tip as an apology for the Seamless confusion. I'm now eating my dinner, and it's wonderful. Great chicken parm grinder and Old Bay fries. Next time I place an order from Manny's, I'm calling them directly!",4,1,3
Still the best place to get a great hoagie for a great price. I live about a 15 min drive from this place an i dont like driving but will take the drive to get their hoagies. The place is often packed if you go between 11-2 an between 5-7. Even on the off hours this place may or may not be packed its the luck of the draw. Today i got lucky no one in front of me however as i ordered my hoagies 5 people came in right behind me. The only caveat is the parking. It is smack in the corner across from a fire station an a few local hotspot bars on a busy street. I went to a deli that i never been to on a trip to shore with a few friends. The hoagie there was bland roll was hard an at $ 6 bucks. The next day i bought Major hoagies an everyone was shocked especially when i said it was only 3.75. What i like about this place if i say Light Mayo its light mayo other places you order your hoagie with light Mayo an still smack a bunch on. . I had about 30 hoagies from this place in the past 4 years an never had a bad one. One word do not attempt to park illegally. The A-Holes parking authority frequently prowl this area like a lion prowls a wounded Antelope.,4,1,3
"Two of us wandering Main Street Manayunk thinking about food are greeted effusively by Zesty's hostess. Clearly this was to be the place. We took outdoor seating as it was reasonably cool for a summer's evening. The Hostess explained the menu and took drink orders. I had the house Merlot. Not bad for a bottom of the price range house wine. My wife had Spanikopita and I had the Ravioli Verde. Served promptly and tasted great. The owner or manager came by several times during our meal and the waiter, Shahab, checked the water, wine, etc. frequently but not obtrusively. There are quite a few things on the menu we'd like to check out so we will be back.",5,2,3
"Elevated vegetarian food! Complex flavors! Highly recommend! The meatballs had notes of harissa almost, not bland at all! The nachos were light and the vegan cheese was delightful! Really impressed with such a creative and flavorful menu! Not sure why the appetizer prices are the same as the entrees. Our waiter was a white male, forgot his name but he seemed frustrated when we couldn't decide on the menu. The menu on their website does not match the menu they have the QR code which threw us off. He literally rolled his eyes when my friend needed a couple of more minutes. Went on 1/12/22 for dinner.",5,2,3
Super grateful to have a place like this in fairmount! By the vast demand and lines out the door you can tell that it has been ovedue. The coffee that I got had spoiled milk. It is not the first time I have ordered a coffee with spoiled milk and I recognize it can happen but when I sent it back and asked for a new one the barrista told me that the milk was definitley not spoiled. Okay....I guess. He begrudgingly gave me a new coffee and I put the milk in myself from where the help yourself things were and round two (without the spoiled milk) was better. It has a nice serene atmosphere and is a nice addition to the neighborhood.,4,1,3
"Lone salesman looking to eat. Sat at the bar was served promptly, beer was cold and fairly priced. Ordered the salmon, which can be risky-usually comes out dry. Bar Amis cooked it perfectly. Well done!",5,2,3
Simple saying here -- the bread of their format tasted real good and won't be spoiled for at least 24 hours in brown bag. Enjoyable edible. Nothing fancier than that and have not tried to eat inside yet. Stay turned!,4,1,3
"While the atmosphere was good and the staff accommodating at first for a large party, the manager quickly realized that having an additional 20 people fill his otherwise sparsely filled bar was too much for him to handle at midnight on a Saturday. Once 1am tolled he quickly stood on a stool and shouted ""leave!"" gesticulating towards the exit. I don't plan on going back.",1,4,3
"YES: -Happy hour. They have a killer happy hour. Get the buns, the curds, the cranberry mule. Set. -Cheese curds. They deserve their own bullet. Seriously, I don't know how they managed to pull off such a fantastic menu item. -Dessert. Whiskey bourbon bread pudding is delicious. Need to try that funetti cake. -Cocktails. They seem to have the mixing game down. -Bathrooms. Super cute and private stalls. There's only three unisex stalls, however, so you may need to wait. -Tiki bar. Bring it back! Such a lovely reprieve from the winter. From what the host said prior to its December closing, the owners are considering re-opening it each winter as a seasonal pop-up. I really hope they do! It was adorable and so welcoming. -Bar seats. So cute, retro and comfy! NO: -Beer. Do not bother. My requested $7 brown ale was a grand cru. I pointed it out and the server told me I was wrong. I was actually not wrong. Small pour too. -Fried chicken. I don't understand. The chicken was dry and boring. The bun was dry and boring. How do all the critics love this dry and boring plate? Or did I just get a poor plate courtesy of Restaurant Week? -High tops behind the bar. I made a RW res at the beginning of January, so when we were pointed to the first high top in front of the door, I requested a different table. Hostess replied by staring at me without using words. I then said, ""Um, can we have this one then?"" (Aka the high-top one back). She hesitantly said okay, but it didn't matter anyway. As a chronically cold person, I froze the whole meal. And the seat was painful. VERDICT: No to Restaurant Week. Yes to Happy Hour. I'd gladly go back and eat/drink their entire HH menu whenever possible. If I did go back for a full meal, I'd request a table in the dining area away from the door. And order a cocktail. Lesson learned.",4,1,3
Service was really nice especially during these hard times and was hard to order and pay.,5,2,3
"From the steamy air and mounds of fresh bagels, you would think this place would make the best bagels ever. It doesn't. Too airy, flat, and the texture a little soft and crumbly. I prefer Philadelphia Bagel Factory and New York Bagel Bakery (althoughneither are perfect). Don't get me wrong, this place is still waaay better than the garbage other places call bagels.",2,5,3
"It pains me to give only two stars, but the shop has declined over the past year. Last fall, the donuts were absolutely perfect. Slightly crispy, soft on the inside, and filled/covered with amazingness. But recently, the shop has gotten so busy that they cant keep up with demand; in response it appears that they stopped cooking the donuts for as long and consequently, more than 50% of the time, the donuts are undercooked. The flavors are still there, but they are almost too doughy to enjoy most days. I cant possibly express my disappointment here as beiler's used to be one of my ""must go""s for people visiting and living in Philly... PLEASE, PLEASE work on it!",2,5,3

Great food - Christmas Day evening menu fixed with 3 of 5 appetizers available. All entrees available. Food was 5 stars!! Prime Rib and Seven Fish Entrees - salads wonderful - dessert perfect! Will go back for the food. View - eh!!!!! Service very poor! We went for good food and got it and hope Christmas evening staff and service was just due to the fact it is a holiday - but I doubt it. Way understaffed ! Staff were actually running to keep up! I feel sorry for the staff. They say restaurants with a great city view are all show - and this was true today EXCEPT food was damn good!!,2,5,3
"I love coming to this place for pizza. I asked for the slice with sausage and pepperoni but was told they didn't have any. Julio saved the day and told me he would put the pepperoni on my slice, no extra charge!! What a great team they have down there. See you guys real soon!!!",4,1,3
"We have been eating at the Conshy location - which is a full restaurant- for many years. The restaurants have great breakfast, salads, etc. This location is for pizza products and garlic bread only IMHO. It's true - you will like or hate this pizza. That's the whole point of it! This location is smaller so it's a different experience but pizza is the same. The pizza is exactly like each review says - whether it's a positive or negative one. Sounds crazy but my son and I love it and my other 2 kids think it's horrible. So even in our family we are split. It doesn't make sense to me for people to say pizza should be a certain way. Each place makes pizza differently. If you have a sweet tooth and like a lot of sauce and thin/breads crust (not crispy) - you will like this. Otherwise you will not. So try it - and if it's not for you then move on. I do think the delivery issues are important and although they warn you - delivery times are at least an hour. They deliver to us even though we are technically outside the area that the website says they deliver to you. And if you call from your landline you don't have to give them your address - makes me nuts that every week I have to tell our fav Chinese take out place our address and phone number. So - the reason that the reviews are so split is because it's a very unique pizza. You will always know if your eating a Franzones pizza. My son and I say pour in the sugar and slather with sauce - we even order it w extra sauce. We need forks to eat it because it's soft. My other kids would rather starve then eat this pizza. So to each their own with Franzones.",5,2,3

"This would've been a 5* but our waiter was not pleasant at all. When we sat down with the hostess our waiter greated us we ordered our drinks and another waiter came up after and greated us again and asked for drink order we said we already placed it with the waiter before him he was confused like we were. When the other waiter came with our drinks he asked him ""oh you got this table?"" I really wish the second waiter was our waiter the guy who stole his table was so unpleasant, no life seemed to be in him. There was no conversation with us when he did cone and ask how our food was I replied ""delicious I bet you take a ""doggy"" bag home for yourself every night, he answered i don't have a dog I said oh I mean for yourself he goes no I don't at all, ?????!!!!!! ‍‍‍‍ some people need to get out of serving. It's the restaurant he works at for crying out loud! He should like the food and even if he didn't like Italian food he should carry a sense of pride for where he's employed....after all it's very expensive and the quality is superb!!!

"Whatever you think of Otolith, and its hard not to love this tiny store, you've got to give credit to the couple behind this courageous venture. The owner gave us a 15 minute summary of what and why they are doing what they are doing. Both husband and wife are/were fishermen, he is still. They know how dire is the situation with obtaining pristine, read that which wont poison us, fish and how it is best for all of us to act sooner rather than later in trying to make the situation better. The $18.00 piece of King salmon as well as the chunk of Alaskan halibut, both frozen, that we bought were without question the finest pieces of fish that I have had in recent memory and at prices that should make Whole Foods feel shame (fat chance). And given their insider's advantage, their relationships with small suppliers takes them outside the sphere of the same old same old vendors that keep perpetuating old and pernicious ways. They are less a vendor of fine and safe seafoods than a tiny company that melds ""commercial fishing experience with the biological sciences while bringing 21st century environmental awareness"" to all of us.

TJ noticed we weren't waited on yet and came to give us our drinks and put our appetizer in so we didn't have to wait any longer.

Water never came as requested. No follow-up on empty drink. No follow-up on food (which was excellent). No dessert follow-up (Too bad!).",2,5,3

"Move over Dinic... and Tony Luke. There's a new contender in my top 3 roast pork sandwich spots. George's is a little hole-in-the-wall, luncheonette type of shop with all of 4-5 sparse tables to squeeze into. By the looks of it, there hasn't been much, if any renovations, since it was opened 65+ years ago. Not to say it's dirty. It's just worn. But with it located in Italian Market, that's part of the charm. One bite of the roast pork sandwich and all of that was forgotten. It ain't pretty, and it ain't frilly. It doesn't need to be. The pork was so juicy and succulent. Flavorful without being overwhelming. Not heavy on the stomach. I haven't tasted anything like it. The experience gave me a new appreciation for pork - the other white meat. Yeah yeah... why does it always have to be a color thing? That's the thing. It isn't. This sandwich transcends color and you're just experiencing meat on a different level. The second time I went, I got it with broccoli rabe and sharp provolone - South Philly style. My mouth is watering as I reminisce.... *slurp* The others who say that the staff isn't friendly, I'd have to disagree. They kept asking if we were enjoying our meals. Within a few verbal volleys, the lady at the counter was giving me the full history... the secret recipe is being passed down through the family. I'd say this experience is priceless. But you can get this for less than $10! What's not to love. It's a true Italian Market/South Philly experience.",5,2,3
First time in Philly this place came highly recommended. The meat was good. Not enough cheese and the sandwich looks nothing like the pictures...skimpy .....WHERE's the Meat?,2,5,3
"For months and months I would drive by this place and wonder why they were not open yet. Finally I noticed that they were and made plans to pay them a visit the next time I was in the neighborhood. I work in Northern Liberties, right up the street from Darlings and as far as I am concerned the bar is set pretty low for a good diner in this part of town. I walked in and was promptly greeted and seated. This is an improvement already. My server was equally quick to check in with me and take my order. I asked for an omelet that was not specifically listed on the menu and they happily accommodated me. I am accustomed to the Darlings egg cake folded over the contents with absolutely no cohesion except for the half melted cheese. I was so pleased that what I got from Mugshot was exactly what I believe a Diner omelet should be; eggs with the ingredients mixed in and then the cheese added and melted in the cooking process. I was also pleased that my toast was served dry with real butter on the side, which is the way I like it since I can't stand the butter blend that so many places use and then call butter. One more thing to mention in the contrast between these two places but I noticed that across the board Mugshot was at least $1 less on each thing that I compared. Bottom line, Mugshot is what I wish Darlings was and I would totally go there often if they were a tad more conveniently located. Oh well. I can still say good things about them.",4,1,3
"Nothing will make my eyes roll in their sockets like a defective slot machine faster than a bank getting into the coffee house business. In order to seriously disrupt the one star service pedigree at most retail banks Capital One opened an honest to goodness java station in Philadelphia's Rittenhouse Square to swaddle their brand in avuncular good feelings and lash millennial tastebuds in yummy (and expensive) caffeine concoctions. Frankly, I take my money seriously and I'll easily forego the frothy cappuccino in favor of things like... I don't know... competitive interest rates and an extensive ATM network. Maybe I'm just old school about the hipness required of my bank but am I the only one who thinks it odd that a bank whose core values should spin on an axis of responsible personal finance sees their point of difference in the sale of frivolous morning dessert beverages at a usurious $8 a clip.

"Let me first say.. I was extremely skeptical of this place for numerous reasons... The ""branding"" of the store outside looks very unimpressive, poorly crafted, and not extravagant. The place replaced Saigon which was ALREADY a dead restaurant to begin with. Then we walked in, and everything changed.. (easily one of my FAVORITE Chinese restaurants next to authentic Sichuanese places to eat). I rarely comprehensively talk about food in great detail but I feel like this place needs justice done -- Environment: Again, nothing impressive as I was expecting but it was most certainly quiet. It seems as if most of the people who eat here are Penn international students who come from China (this was my first eyebrow raised.. wondered if the locals really enjoyed it.) Service: It took a while for the food to come out. We ordered and despite not having many people in the restaurant, my friend who ordered one of the lunch specials got his food in 5 min, and took my food (look under food section) and it took 15 minutes. Despite the lack of service, this place REALLY DESERVED its 5 stars from the food and price ALONE. Food: This was incredible. I feel like I don't even want to say anymore. If you want the full Northern Chinese experience, please please please get some of their special items.. I personally tried the cumin beef which was DELECTABLE. No joke: it was salty, aromatic, and oddly enough BROUGHT ME BACK down memory lane. I did indeed visit Southern China, and I KNOW this place is a NORTHERN Chinese delight; however, the food replicates EXACTLY the same one the people in China would use. Even the same exact salty meat with it's bland hand-drawn noodles were interestingly an amazing combo that I would never trade away. The dumplings weren't anything significant but much much better than the standard ones' in Philly (great texture lightly doused in hot oil). Most of their dishes comes with their cabbage and I can see exactly why this could be a turn-off. It was extremely sour and pickled. But I can tell you now, this is as accurate as it gets. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, give this a try and a chance if you expect A QUALITY AUTHENTIC NORTHERN CHINESE CUISINE EXPERIENCE. Everything from the food to the tea is on-point. I can see why people don't like it.. it definitely does not fit the Western palate.. Price: To eat at a comfortable amount, my dish alone was around $9 while sharing dumplings for a grand total of $13.50 after tax and tip per person. This was an easy busy considering the quality of food I got (see above in food section). Can't wait to try the one in Chinatown next.",5,2,3

"UPDATE: In keeping with the theme that Serpico's food is great, but expensive, now that I've had a chance to look at the wine list more closely (see link in Part 2 of my opening night review below), the average markup from retail seems to be on the high side (3-5X): '09 Prum Graacher Himmelreich Kabinett, $28 wine for $110 (3.9X) '09 Trimbach Pinot Blanc 2009, $15 wine for $74 (4.9X) '10 Banshee & Rickshaw Pinot Noir, $15 wine for $50 (3.3X) NV Kanbara Bride of Fox Junmai Ginjo, $15 saki for $58 (3.9X) '11 Domaine Jerome Gradassi Chateauneuf-du-Pape, $39 wine for $170 (4.4X) I'm sorry, but $74 for a $15 bottle of wine is highway robbery in Philly. In fact, you can get this wine retail for $10.19 in NJ (7.3X markup): http://www.wineclicker.com/items/detail?itemid=463345 BTW, I didn't get an answer to my question as to whether they would let us BYOB with corkage.

Next, I absolutely love vegetables, and I reviewed the menu before going to the restaurant, and had read reviews regarding the best options to experience. It just didn't work out for me. In the week prior, I had gone to Vernick, and had a few of their vegetable offerings and I was totally delighted, and blown away by how fantastic they were. I wish I had something more positive to say, but I had indicated previously that their service and atmosphere is fantastic.",2,5,3

"An insanely busy restaurant with good food. I had a terrible experience recently with a missing item in my order. The girl on the phone handled it very poorly, it left a bitter taste in my mouth. I was ready to forgo going back to Penang. It took my aunt having to barge in there in person to get the issue remedied. I was told on the phone that they would check the cameras to see if the ""item was packed"" this wording obviously didn't help. She almost disregarded that the Beef Rendang in my order was even missing. I left my name and number with her and I was going to leave it at that. My aunt decides that it was a situation that needed to be handled in person, so she goes in the store. The manager, I believe, handles it calmly and says the kitchen will now prepare it for us. I'd like to believe that this happened because they found out they did make an error on their part. I like this place. I like the food here, I like this guy--he seems to care about the restaurant. I'd give a 3.5 but I figured I'll just round up and sway people to come here instead of those other choices (like that leaf place, quality and quantity over there are both garbage nowadays). So, I would recommend this place, but I will never order delivery/pick up again. Customer service department needs a desperate re-haul. To end this on a positive note, their satay is delicious. The peanut satay sauce will have you addicted. Their Pad Thai is one of my favorites in the city and roti canai (Indian pancake) is a classic that should always be included in your meal.",4,1,3
"Welcome to the 5 Star Club, helm! This is one of the best restaurants I've been to in a while. The location of the restaurant isn't too ideal, but they're really doing something right to draw people there. The only thing they need to change is the signage out front. I drove by it twice before finding it. Hint to those reading this: it's right next door to the Mexican restaurant. This BYOB has a limited menu, but they've managed to pack it with creativity and a certain distinction for anyone who loves dining out. All of the food tastes fresh and the best part is it's very reasonably priced for the quality of food. The most expensive item was $25. For an appetizer I had the Carrots, Chevre, Basquaise. I like carrots, but helm gave me a reason to love them here. They were smoked that gave it a completely different taste to them. They were complimented nicely with the melted chevre cheese and the peppery basquaise sauce. As for my entree, I had the NY Strip Steak, Broccoli, Jalapeno. It was a large piece of steak that came out already sliced. I usually get a steak medium, but they prepare it medium rare. I might have found a reason to change my ways! Besides the food being amazing, the service was just as good. They don't have menus, but rather a chalkboard. Instead of just reading it, the gentleman who took the orders came over and gave an extensive and detailed description of each of the dishes making it a lot easier in making a decision. This place definitely makes the list of ones to return to. My one last piece of advice is to make a reservation as it's not an entirely big restaurant.",5,2,3
"Respectable, they don't skimp like Gia Pronto",4,1,3
"Really wanted to love this place. I've been here twice now and the chicken has gotten better but the sides need work. Probably one of the worst biscuits I've ever had, and that really really pains me to say. The chicken (spicy) is really flavorful and tender though. Pricing is spot on as well. Really hope they work it out because I love the idea of fast casual but great food in South Philly!",2,5,3
"The owner is a scumbag all of them , they treat their employees like crap, I worked there and quite frankly I'm happy I'm gone , I hate all of them but the employees for the most part are good , I say they have some good food and their cooks are pretty good as well. For the most part I love the hostesses but other r than that if I could give less than 1 star I would and that's sad coming from a former employee",1,4,3
"Bonk's is a local's local bar. Came here for an Eagles game one Sunday, the place was filled with lifers from around Port Richmond, customers and employees. We came for crabs. #1 blues were about 7 dollars each. There was a special on for what they called rock crab, at two for 4 dollars. These crabs came cleaned and split. They had the same shape and flavor as a dungeness crab, except smaller and with black tipped claws. I can tell these came in frozen and reheated, but they were good nevertheless. Blue crabs are served dirty (whole, delicious ""mustard"" and all) with or without a pool of Bonk's juice; a briny, spicy boiling liquid that sends the sea bugs to their graves. Then they were all washed down with dollar pints of Bud Light (shitty light beer is the only beer to have with crabs). And to top it off, the fries stay impossibly crisp forever. No joke. Maybe the lukewarm crabs when served were an issue, but I can't remember. All I can recall is a bright white light followed by shell fragments everywhere.",4,1,3
Try the Chicken Taco Wrap... its totally money.,4,1,3
"There was a line that reached the door when I came here. Tried a strawberry iced drink here, but it had way too much of an artificial taste for me.",1,3,2
"Went in and probably hit a good time. There was a line, but wasn't too long. Just a few minutes later and it was getting crazy though. Had an iced mocha, great coffee! It was rich, but not sweetened. They have different sweetener options so you can get it just like you want. I'd like to give the food a try sometime. Delicious.",5,3,2
German chocolate brownie is really good. Very fresh and moist. I'd come back again next time I'm in philly,3,5,2
"Food sizes are extremely small and really expensive for what it is. Food comes out at different times, which isn't an issue if there was only a small lag. I received my food and finished it before the other people at my table even got theirs. You're better off just taking a picture with the painting on the door and walking to another restaurant.",1,3,2
"Friendly staff, and good food. Not amazing, but good and at a fair price. I came here for the Ethiopian food, so I can't comment on the coffee shop aspect.",3,5,2
"Tamarind chicken had too much fish sauce, and Bahn Mi was inauthentic. The waitress was sweet, and the decor was calm and interesting. Nice spot to grab a drink at the bar, and listen to some chill music.",2,4,2
"I was hankering for a top notch burger and decided to stop by here with a friend since I live in the neighborhood and have biked by many times. I'm nervous at times when a restaurant is listed as casual attire - just how casual? Upon my trips past this place since it has opened I've seen nothing but seemingly businessmen and women packed to the gills inside, so I have the ever present fear of embarrassing street-denial. Don't be worried - neither the host nor our server lost a beat upon seeing my wonderful bright purple shirt and camo shorts. If there was one aspect of dinner I was truly impressed by, it was the service. Our server was absolutely delightful and provided one of the best experiences I've had on that end in a while. Informative, prompt and with a great sense of humor, you absolutely cannot beat good service. We sat outside, which is always a plus if offered, but Fairmount Ave is a little noisy at night time, and especially so during the warmer months. I was not a fan of the rickety tables and cheap, thin-metal chairs. For food we were absolutely set on the Hickory Burgers, as neither of us had been to Rouge. Unfortunately, like everyone else in the city we had read the LaBan review from last week, and they were regrettably out. We opted to share the NY Strip and Roasted Pork Tenderloin instead. I was unimpressed with the NY Strip. It was cooked to temperature, and exceptionally moist and juicy, but seemingly lacked seasoning. The butter was good, but in a city where you can get steaks anywhere I always seem to have hit-or-miss experiences with them at all but the premier ""we do steaks"" places. The frites accompanying were crisp and salted just enough, but were not altogether memorable. If I'm going for a straight taste of the meat, I might seek out the Steak Tartare I saw on the menu if it's around next visit. The pork loin was also cooked very well, and I thought it was a better dish - cheaper, too. The sweet potato puree and Swiss chard seemed at odds, but the dish did work well together. We didn't BYO anything but I wish we would have. I'm a little sad, actually, to hear of their imminent acquisition of a liquor license as I do love the BYOs around the city, and this place seems perfect for one, especially with the PLCB store right on the next block down the street. I will be returning, at a minimum to have a burger, but also probably to try their seafood dishes, which seem to have more positive reviews in general. I suppose I had just suffered too large a blow hearing about the lack of burgers, and maybe that spoiled my enthusiasm on this visit.",4,2,2
"Stopped here on my lunch break and spent the majority of my time in line waiting to order my food as the cashier was moving like a snail; and no they weren't busy, just slow. They have a wide variety of menu options to order from, which is pretty cool. I ended up ordering the fish over rice platter which I'd say was a 4-10. The rice tasted old in my opinion but the cucumber salad and pita was pretty good,I should've just gotten that. All in all this place has room for improvement if they hired more cashiers things would be smooth sailing.",1,3,2
OMG my school went here on a class trip in middle school! It was the first and last time I've been to the Market. I wandered around with a few classmates and we ate Chinese food for lunch and matriculated throughout the place until I felt like I found out what it would be like to be an ant in an ant farm. There was even a news story going on and we tried to be in the background but the chick who was the reporter shooed us away. This was one of many fun class trips to Philly that serve as reminders of why I love New Jersey.,4,2,2
"They have signs on every window stating ""Open 24 hours"" so perhaps they had a transition phase. The service was much better this time, the food was the same (decent) and the coffee lukewarm. Don't get the lemon meringue pie.",3,1,2
"This place is OK. If you're not from Philly and you've never orderd a steak be prepared to be scrutinized. Wit means you want cheese wiz. American means you want American cheese. The lady who works there will give you the eye and make you feel like your'e from another planet if you don't do it correctly. I wonder if she stops to think that without tourist and out of towers, this place wouldn't be open. Even with all that, I've had much better cheesesteaks....outside of Philly. This place looks like it should be in Vegas it's lit up like a christmas tree. If you go in the winter, be prepated to freeze your buns off; it's outside seating only. Go next door to the Yogurt shop and get a coffee and eat your steak in warmth,",3,1,2
Blonde bartender spent more time on her phone than tending the bar. Food was ok. Not worth another visit.,1,3,2
"We had a great experience here on a Friday night in April. Philadelphia is the central location to meet when my college friends and I get together, but we've done Center City so many times, sometimes it's just not worth the hassle. We chose Manayunk, and particularly the Goat's Beard, to try something new and a hopefully find a spot where you could heard conversation. It helped that we were there the weekend preceeding Easter - most college kids were home, so the town was a bit quieter. There's a paid parking lot across down a block and across the street - Venice Island. It was $8 for the evening until midnight. We walked in around 9:30 and the bar was pretty full, but there was still room to move around. We found the hostess' stand, but it was the manager who came, greeted us, and seated us at a high-top table just next to the bar. The Goat's Beard has an EXTENSIVE cocktail list. I tried three of the signature drinks - The Goat's Beard, the Old Fashioned, and the Town & County (which was the best of the three - made with maple syrup, rye, antica, and rhubarb bitters). Prices were about $9/drink. Non-signature drinks were around $6 and beer around $4. Best part of the night? Acoustic guitarist who set up shop not far from us, covering my favorite early-2000's acoustic/alternative bands. It was like my favorite station on Pandora - but live!! Can't attest to the food - we just imbibed in the extensive drink menu! Goat's Beard is the place to go in Manayunk for late-twenties/early-thirty-something-year olds. If I lived nearby, I'd be there every weekend.",5,3,2
"It's my favorite place in all of Philadelphia. I don't go out often (maybe 2x a week), but when I do, this place is always in the conversation. Uhhh, I'm kidding. I'm here at least once a week if not more and it's no longer part of the 2x a week conversation. I'm a regular. At least half a dozen people know my name. I love the booths around the bar. Great for inconspicuous people watching. Menu (ranked in order) Gambas - dip your bread in the sauce Mussels - dip your bread in the sauce Chicken Pimientos - dip your bread in the sauce Pan con Tomate - do not share Albondigas - dip your bread in the sauce Bravas - dip your bread in the sauce Potato Tortilla - do not share Croquettes - ok to share Empanadas - ok to share Broccoli Rabe - ok to share Calamari - ok to share I order the Gambas and the Bravas every time I'm here. I didn't even list the charcuterie. They have a build your own option which I go for once a month or so. Menu is quite descriptive on flavor profiles, which is great for the cheese portion of the menu. My cocktail of choice is the Whisky Root. The ginger bits are everything! It just makes me feel like I'm being healthy you know? I love it here...",5,3,2
"If I was rating the natural wine list, it would be a 5. Great selection of tasty wines at what I believe are fair prices. A++++ there. That said, I had incredibly high expectations for the pizzas, but they were not met and certainly were not exceeded. Now let me preface this with this... we make a lot of pizza at home and have spent a few years mastering our own Neapolitan-style dough. We also make our own sauce and dabble in many toppings, so we are not traditional pizza lovers so to speak. The Eeva pizzas both look and sound delicious - and I love the topping selections that were offered at the time of our visit (shout out to Charlito's salami picante which I am quite obsessed with - that and their chorizo). Loved the space. Service was great. Loved the ricotta. And did I say I loved the wine list? With it being a pizza-focused place, though, I may come back someday, but I am not itching to.",3,5,2
"Very nice service, vibe, music (which isn't too loud), and food was good! The people in my party liked their food, which ranged from the veggie burger, the brisket, the fish & chips, and more. I had asked to substitute my cole slaw for veggies, but the waiter had said the cole slaw was a small thing, so I just said nevermind not a problem! And then when my plate came out, I had a side of veggies! I thought maybe I might be charged for an extra side by when I checked the bill at the end of the meal, the veggies were nowhere to be found :) So thank you to the kind waiter for being awesome about telling us the history of the restaurant, being patient about our menu question and food choices, and for giving me my veggies! I'm no Philly local, but I thought this place was fairly priced with good food and nice atmosphere. Definitely recommend for both locals and visitors!",5,3,2
"The service out shined the food by far. Everyone we encountered was so attentive, knowledgeable, and personable. It seemed like they sincerely enjoyed working there. The food was incredibly over salted to the point where I was going through water like a fish. I could only eat 1/3rd of my suckling pig. Definitely not impressed.",3,1,2
"Finally, Philly has caught on and followed NYC in the endeavor of starting restos like this...c'mon, you know yuppies love tapas. Duh. I've been to Barcelona and eaten the best of the best tapas...so this review may not be fair...but to be honest, the food here was actually good. Octopus was on point. Croquetas were deelish. Iberian ham was like butta'. Olives and cheese plate was status quo. The cava wine was refreshing. Lots and lots of chicks in groups. Lots of dates all around. But where are the latin servers? Are there no hispanic people in Philly?",3,5,2
"I've been thinking about writing this review for quite a while. The reason I've been putting it off has been the inconsistency of my experience at this market. In the past 6 months, I may have bought 5 hoagies for lunch here. The quality of each has ranged from inedible to lately two of the best italian hoagies I have ever had. Coincidentally, the last 2 hoagies I purchased during our last 2 snowstorms and the shop wasn't busy. On a normal day the line to order may be 20 people deep at times. So rather than tempt fate I will continue to make this my go to choice during blizzards and limit my culinary range to the italian hoagie.",3,5,2
"So, to be clear, our take-out tacos were delicious, and the staff was friendly and helpful (thank you Katie for talking my boyfriend, who has dietary restrictions, through his options) but if I can't physically pick the taco up and eat it because it isn't double layered and just falls apart I'm gonna feel a certain way about paying $13 for two.",3,5,2
"$5 breakfast on weekdays between 7 and 9, yo. The latkes are not what I would consider a latke, and kind of a gross triangular wedge of potato and onion instead, but I heartily endorse the biscuit. They do not fuck up the eggs, which I appreciate.",5,3,2
Good pizza but they struggle terribly with delivery. Expect a least an hour wait any day of the week. Often shows up cold and hard.,3,1,2
"Love the food there! Parmagana pizza (prosciutto spinach) and steamed mussels with Alfredo sauce and white wine! Audience is ok, sometimes very loud but OK in general! Love the live music in the evening!!!",5,3,2
This sandwich shop is so awesome. 5 bucks or so. Fantastic bread. Great traditional sandwich. Friendly employees. Bail on Subway or Hoagies or Grinders or Cheesteak and give it a shot.,3,5,2
"Finally had me some Home Slice and ive got to tip my hat off to you boys. Well done. Being a pizza snob (i dont rate pizza unless it falls into the same category as Delorenzo's Trenton, Vince's NE Philly, Denino's Staten Island, you get me...) I didnt expect much from this foo-foo Vegan friendly spot. I was pleasantly surprised. The pie was crisp with just enough cheese to make it stretch just enough before tearing away with each bite. ill be back!",3,5,2
"Came here earlier on a Sunday morning just before the lunch rush and got seated immediately. Our family of 5 ordered all three soup dumpling dishes, a beef chow fun, a bean curd dish, and two appetizers. But I'll just focus on the soup dumplings. The dough was thicker than usual, but it was in good proportion to all the meat and soup! There's really not much difference in flavor between the pork and crab buns, so I would just stick with the pork ones from now on. But great soup flavor and meat stuffing. The beef chow fun had the crucial pan smoked flavor.",5,3,2
"The food was good and our server was friendly and attentive. We went in after a show at the Kimmel Center around lunchtime on a Saturday. The hostesses though, were terrible. When we walked in they were too engrossed in their conversation and ignored us for a good 2 minutes. When we finally got seated, the hostesses were MIA and people kept walking in and getting ready to leave because there was nobody to greet them and get them seated.",3,1,2
"This review is for happy hour only** After all the hype I was pretty disappointed by Porta, I'm sad to say :( The vibe is really cool overall, with garage doors open to the street and shared, picnic table seating (on one side of the restaurant).. but here's why it didn't meet my expectations: -Happy Hour cocktails were drenched in simple syrup to the point that they were inedible. Not worth $6. -The sliders (meatball and peppers) from the happy hour menu were cold when we got them and the baguette was so hard that we couldn't even bite through the sliders -The Three Trees salad was supposed to have prosciutto (yum) but instead came with crunchy bacon bits that tasted out of a container. It was soaked in a bitter vinaigrette. Would not recommend. We left bummed. I have heard that the pizza is good so I will plan to try that if I ever make it back and will update if so.",3,1,2
"Ordered take out after having eaten in the restaurant. The restaurant experience was great. Loved every single bite, super flavorful! Unfortunately the take out was not at the level I remembered. The Lamb vindaloo was good, definitely a small portion but good. The saag paneer was very soupy, lacking the creaminess and the flavor that you would expect. The ""baby eggplant cooked in hot tamarind sauce"" was soupy and full of garlic cloves Finally the paneer dosa was super greasy.... I love this place and I really hope this was a one off experience!",3,5,2
Grew up in that area. Glad to hear of all great restaurants up Passyunk Avenue and stateside being number one. We ran. Ok small plate place = small plates of okay food for same price as regular size meals at other great restaurants. Oysters were delicious yet ate one that had off smell and taste and I couldnt eat anymore oysters. Just mentioned it to waitress got a blank stare. Drinks were fun to try since they were olden day drinks that you only hear about. But would have enjoyed having full happy tummy for $ we spent from the NUMBER 1best of phila.,2,4,2
Don't use DoorDash or any other ordering service. Your food will not show up. This has happened to me twice now. They have their own driver but for some reason our order never gets delivered.,3,1,2
"their parking lot is a nightmare but once you circle it like 70 times, once inside its worth it..it is pretty tight with a cart but the prices and quick lines make up for it. I'm a bargain shopper so I use store brands and shop rite brand is top notch, the store card helps you save more money as well, so if you want to stretch your dollar I recommend shopping here.",3,5,2
"If you have a hankering for sweets, look no further than Swiss Haus. Having heard of the cronut for what seems like forever, I finally decided to give my husband something he would not forget on a snowy Valentine's Day - food. I was shocked to see that the cronut is actually a monstrosity. Seriously folks, they're big. But I got two anyway, chocolate and vanilla. Because you know, I had to try both flavors! The cronut did not disappoint, but really one is enough for two people to share and at $5 a piece, you probably want to bring a few friends with you. They only make them on the weekdays, so if you're looking for something sweet for Saturday or Sunday brunch, grab them on Friday morning. Excited to try some of the other sweet-toothed options at Swiss Haus, as they looked divine.",4,2,2
"Would love to able to review the food but couldn't, walked out after an hour and watching 5 other tables get served before us. Their food looked delicious though. Smelled great too. Coffee and water was pretty good. While nice, no one working there gave an excrement about what happened. (Update, they emailed me and offered me a gift card, didn't take it I was just happy to be acknowledged, so that was cool of them, thanks)",1,3,2
"Used to love this place. Took my gf here on our first date and all.. Fat Salmon has overtaken my heart on this one. I dont know what happened RAW, theyre just better. However, if you are here, the Tuna tar tar will is the best. If this joint ever loses that appetizer, im afraid itll be the end of my 3 yr love affair with Raw",3,5,2
"When some people go to Philadelphia, they think of Philly cheesesteaks. When they think of cheesesteaks, they usually think of either Pat's or Geno's. Those of you who talk to me about food probably already know that when I think of Pat's or Geno's, I think of paying ten dollars for the privilege of standing in a line, waiting for half an hour, and getting substandard tourist-trap tier food. After the experience, most people now need to brainwash themselves into thinking that they've made some sort of good financial and or culinary decision, lest their common sense takes over and they realize that they've been suckered by an establishment that prides themselves in serving fake cheese from an aerosol can on top of meat so dry and haphazardly made that even pre-2000's era Taco Bell would not think to use it in their food. Enter Koja, a Korean place that does a real cheesesteak, with real cheese, bulgogi meat, and can give it some heat if you want it to. For the same price, or a little cheaper, you get a much better cheesesteak with some stuff on the side, with none of the soul-wrenching guilt. Although I've only been twice, and only ever had their bulgogi cheesesteak, I've gotta say it's probably the best cheesesteak I've had in Philly. I've been to the famous, less-famous, and local stores, and this place beats them all. The meat is great, and they use real cheese. Definitely get it spicy!",4,2,2
Very good pizza. Good delivery. Had this pizza many times before. Never dissappoints if you order pizza. One time I got a Greek salad. I will stick to pizza. Greek salad was mediocre at best & used canned olives. Big turn off.,4,2,2
"Searched out this spot for breakfast today. Sounded great, so off I went with my wife and daughter. Sadly, they were closed today. Best to call ahead if you are going there. Love the outside environment, except it was pouring rain, off to Cake we went. Delicious!",3,5,2
"The quality at Rybread has come down. When they opened, they made a lot of absolutely outstanding sandwiches, but I've noticed more and more corners being cut despite their wild success. As a for instance, the San Antonio, formerly an absolutely incredible cold roast-beef sandwich, just melt-in-your-mouthy deliciousness, has had its roast beef replaced with... some other kind. Maybe it's a good brand like Boar's Head -- I'm willing to believe that -- but regardless, it certainly hasn't been a good change. Similarly, I've noticed a decline in the amount of meat and the amount of various toppings that make it onto the sandwiches. It's still a fine sandwich place -- the best among zero competition in the neighborhood -- but it used to be a GREAT place, and it's depressing that it just... isn't anymore.",3,5,2
"Went for happy hour with a friend. Experience is as follows: Drinks: meh Happy hour snacks: ok Service: very good, friendly Atmosphere: amazing! Drinks and food were ok but the restaurant decor literally made our mouths drop. It is too cute. Bartender that did happy hour for us was super friendly and accommodating!",3,5,2
"this place is 5 stars in the you get what you pay for and what you are expecting category. ok first off the drinks and the food is fairly priced. you usually do not have to wait for a table. the wait staff is attentive and the service is good. they seat big parties and do not have problems splitting bills or taking my multiple restaurant . com coupons i'm always using. secondly they have all types of vegan options, clearly labeled on the menu. third they have KARAOKE that is so much fun! seriously try it out. this place isnt fancy, it isnt trendy, it isnt high brow BUT it is affordable, comfortable, fun and a GREAT place to go if you want to have a nice dinner and dinks with friends",5,3,2
"I think given our experience, a 3 is generous but there were some aspects of this place that were nice. Our server was nice and they have a lot of vegan options which is always exciting for me (and why we came here). It's rare to find a vegan french toast when dining out and I was so excited for it. It was hands down the worst breakfast I have ever eaten. When they brought it out, I thought it was a chocolate bread but no...it was burnt. It's just deep fried bread. There was so much oil and grease in it that I felt sick. With each bite, my mouth became saturated with oil and the bread seemed to disintegrate. I can't even explain how bad it was. My husband ordered the regular chicken parm sandwich and said it was good but he felt sick afterwards too. We had to cancel our plans for the rest of the day and get a ride home where we both ended up throwing up. Part of me wants to come back to try the other menu items but I don't know if I can given how horrible our experience was today. If I do though, I will stay far away from the vegan French toast.",3,1,2
I finally got to try this place! It was better than i expected! The food took a bit to come out but it was worth the wait. I had the karai and it was very flavorful. The fatty pork was cooked just right. I wish there were more seats available. People were stalking people for tables... umm felt like i was in Flushings Chinatown Mall. Overall it was good. FYI spoke to the cashier and they are putting more tables in. Yay!,5,3,2
"I'm not a HUGE Mexican food fan, but there is no way I can give this place anything less than 5 stars. It's a well-done place, a great atmosphere, and a pretty cool location. The food is darn tasty...I've enjoyed it as much as any other restaurant in the city (but I keep my selections simple, ya know?) The place can be crowded...but never packed or ridiculous, etc. Reservations make it easy. Parking (local, free) is not much of an issue either. Prices are decent...and the margaritas are top-notch! This place is just another piece of the culinary puzzle that makes Philadelphia the best food city in the world! How dare New Yorkers call Philly their ""sixth borough""! They can keep their overpriced steakhouses and ""New York"" soft pretzels...what a joke!",5,3,2
"I came here with a friend on a Sunday afternoon. We were in Philly for the night, looking for something nearby the hotel before hitting the road. I have to be honest, I was impressed. The menu was quite nice, the food well prepared and presented, the service attentive, and the price very reasonable.",5,3,2
"Food is outstanding! Atmosphere is great! Outside bar is fun and lively! But...the bartenders. They have a chip on their shoulder. Too many times I've been at the outside bar and they don't even acknowledge your existence. They walk back and forth in front if you without a glance. At least say ""hello I'll be with you shortly."" They're slow, unfriendly, and have an attitude. And this is when it's not crowded. There have been several times my wife and I thought of going but decided to venture elsewhere because of the bartenders. I'll be back because it's practically in my backyard and the food is good but not as much as we would if the bartenders had a personality and dropped the attitude.",4,2,2
"Picked this spot to hide from all the pre-Super Bowl shows and hype. It was about half full inside but only one bartender working both the bar and those of us sitting at tables for food. Overall good experience and the food came out quick and hot. Only disappointment was the onion rings appetizer - completely tasteless. We tried the dip it came with, adding salt and pepper - it was just very flavorless coating. We each tried one and didn't touch them again. The bartender didn't ask how we were enjoying things because honestly he was really busy, so it was a shame to leave an entire plate of food behind.",4,2,2
"I don't like to experiment with brunch food. When I'm on the verge of vomiting and still feeling drunk from the night before, the last thing i want is a burrito stuffed with eggs and avocado. I like omelets covered with ketchup, toasted bagels covered with cream cheese and endless cups of orange juice.",2,4,2
"The food is ok, but we have had better here in the past. The main reason we went was for the cheese fries. This was always our hot spot for them. Things have obviously changed. We ordered 2 large cheese fries for the table. We ended up leaving an entire basket of fries that did not have cheese. When we asked if they would put more cheese, we were told that they would charge us. When I asked why they would charge us when it is obvious that it wasn't enough cheese we were told that they use a specific amount. If we can't get good cheese fries here I guess we will go across the street to Five Guys.",3,1,2
"I'm giving 5 stars bc it's Black owned and I'm always rooting for everybody Black. But truthfully, i wasn't that impressed and prob wouldn't order again. I had the red velvet waffle fried chicken sandwich. It was just ok. My expectations were a little high...maybe other items are better but it's just blah to me.",5,3,2
"Ordered a Caesar salad with shrimp but received a salad w/ tomatoes and red peppers. I didn't ask for that. But I think they were trying to compensate for the missing components of the Caesar, whatever the case, Would have been polite to put them on the side or give me the choice to choose a differ salad. They did take my name and number when I ordered.",1,3,2
"I have been here 4 times. The place looks really cool. The service as noted in other reviews is lackluster and unprofessional. The servers look sloppy and lack attentiveness - but I guess that is what Northern Liberties is about. You can tell too when you look at the condiments on the table- they could be cleaner. The kitchen closes weirdly for one hour between 4-5. All that being said - I will be back. The brisket sandwich is the best. I get it with less butter (if you don't it has way too much butter) Fries are awesome. The bottled beer comes out a little too warm - we all want nice cold beers. The bourbon pecan pie with sweet potato ice cream is excellent. I also had the chile rellano and it was awesome as well. Really different than expected and I love that. Oh, and the soda is off too... it is not good. When it was Deuce's the soda was not good either - maybe they kept the same lines. Even with the service and beverage flaws, the food is SO GOOD (kudos to the chef)- I will be back. Love the hours too. Being open late night until 1am is a bonus. It is not often I go to a place with medicore service because the food is so good!",4,2,2
"Good ramen. Hostess was rude and looked like she was the waitress too so she was running around. Got seated after 30 mins at the bar even though we came before other people and asked for the table and didn't give it to us but gave it to people after us. Rude how she didn't care. Plates were thrown in front of us instead of put down gently since they were in a rush. Waiters were screaming across the room to each other and were rushing me to get out when I just put my spoon down to finish. Although the ramen was good, it wasn't the best I've ever had. The atmosphere is fast paced and too crazy everywhere around the restaurant; therefore, not my cup of tea. As a result, I will not be coming back.",3,1,2
"Dined in the restaurant on Saturday night with a few friends. We were referring to it as the ""old people side"" since the bar side of the restaurant seemed way younger and since we were seated between a 6-top and 4-top of at least 60 year olds. It felt like the early bird, but it was 8pm. Anywho, the food was outstanding, the cheese board was delicious, burger was amazing, mussels were bland and didn't bring out any of the delectable ingredients in the broth, the grilled octopus was divine as well. The reason this place gets a 3 is clearly the service. I see that several Yelpers also have something less than nice to say. Jake's - you really need to clean house and have service that matches the food, otherwise people will stop coming. Our server, Richard (Dick), was a real pompous jerk. I would order a Riverhorse Tripel, but since I pronounced it as ""triple"" (which is definitely used in the beer world to describe a triple or tripel style ale), I was corrected, not once but twice, in an extremely condescending tone by the waiter enunciating ""TRI-PEL, so you'll have the Riverhorse Tripel"". This was the only ""Tripel"" on the menu and was the 1st beer listed, I think he knew what I wanted. Then there was some waiter-induced confusion in ordering the cheese and charcuterie plate. We began by ordering the 2 cheeses for the plate and waiter-man suggested their smoked gouda dip. We were clearly within the confines of ordering the charcuterie and were talked into the smoked gouda. When we tried to complete the plate, Dick said the smoked gouda is a separate dish and not included. At this point, he must have thought we were idiots and could not differentiate 2 separate items on a menu. He corrected us again and we ended up with a delicioius charcuterie plate. The 3rd and last straw was my ordering of the moscato. I simply asked for the moscato which was on the dessert menu in my hand. Again, with condescension, he perfectly enunciates ""Oh, the Moscato d'Asti"" in perfect snooty italian. I would go to this place for the outstanding food, but to be mocked by the service without cause or provocation is so unprofessional, I am never going back nor would I recommend this place to anyone I know.",3,5,2
New steaks are so bad go back to the old meats. Been going here for at least 12 years and my family from Virginia even didn't finish their steaks. Gave it 2 stars just because of remembering good times,2,4,2
"Have been here several times and the food is always delicious. We returned last night for Sugo Sunday and relearned a lesson-don't go out on Valentines Day. While all the servers were super nice, the courses were so rushed we could hardly enjoy them. We also recalled having more generous servings at our last visit particularly for dessert. The homemade ricotta is worth the trip but go later in the evening and maybe you won't be as rushed.",3,5,2
Service was so so. However the food was good. This was our second time eating at this place.,5,3,2
"Food was great, pacing of food was strange. Waiters were constantly trying to take plates away before we even finished them. It felt like we were constantly being interrupted. They should iron that out.",4,2,2
"These people charge roughly the same as a Philly bar, and not a high-end one. Like sitting in a Two Street tavern while waiting for your flight. After being ripped off by the standard ""$3 more for a 'double' shot industrial airport bars, this is an oasis.",3,1,2
"After coming here half a dozen times at the beckoning of other and trying several variations of the Pho, as well as the spring role, the Bánh mì and once even venturing into the more substantial dishes like the grilled beef short ribs, I have decided that mediocrity is the only common denominator in the food at Pho Palace. Like Jessica E., I too, upon discovering Pho Palace, had hoped to avoid the long drive to Pho 75 for a simple bowl of Pho on a cold day or Cafe Saigon for a tasty Vietnamese hoagie, both of which located on Adams Ave. But sadly, like Jessica E., I was disappointed at the complexity of the Pho broth. Frankly, the Pho needed more beef - but more importantly it needed cloves, coriander, star anise, cardamom and time to stew. The Bánh mì (hoagie) seemingly had all the right components: grilled pork, pickled dikon & carrots, cucumber, a secrete sauce, all topped with cilantro. But the major failure was the most basic of elements in any sandwich - the bread. It was not all together the fresh crusty brioche it aught to have been. The actual grilled pork left also something to be desired but it was forgivable - I guess. The service has its twists and turns here too. Orders are generally brought out in a flurry, with little consideration to common sense. Who in hell wants to eat salad while their soup cools inches away? This is not to say the everything is a wash at Pho Palace. The desserts, which are prepackaged delectable that are not made on site but purchased, are surprisingly very good. The ambiance of the place is quite a bit nicer then most Pho places and one can dine alfresco in the warmer months, a plus for those of us with pups in tow, though there is not much of a view. All in all, the reasonable pricing, local, ambiance are the real draw here. But if you want good Pho look elsewhere, you would be wise to survey up and down Adams Ave. P.S This place is Cash only, as others have mentioned, but an ATM is on premises.",2,4,2
As most have said there was a wait when we visited the Trolley Car. It was New Years day so a 30 minute wait was expected. I knew the they had a good beer selection but not 214! The menu is robust but we were only looking for breakfast. I didn't really go over the rest of the menu. I decided on the Eggs and Hash and my girlfriend had a pork roll sandwich. The corn beef hash is made in house and is the best I have ever had. I will be going back soon it was so good. The eggs were cooked as I asked and the home fries were great. My girlfriend liked her sandwich and had to take 1/2 of it home. As we were eating I noticed the man who was clearing the tables. He was working his A** off. I can't say the same for our waitress. She rushed my GF when taking our order. She never checked to see if we needed coffee so I had to ask for more. This didn't make a difference because we never got a refill. She did come over and hit both our empty cups with her stomach as she took the syrup from our table. I watched her stand with her hands folded and watch the man bus tables. She obviously didn't like to help out. When she brought our check ($19) we asked for a box to take the 1/2 sandwich home. I then went up to pay at the register. On my way back I made sure to tip the man clearing tables. I'm in the service industry and I can appreciate his strong work ethic. When I got back from paying my girlfriend still had not got a box. I walked up and asked for one myself. I always leave 20% for a tip but I just couldn't do it this time. Our waitress was so bad I think we left her $1.50 and a quick note. Even though our server was horrid I will be going back. I want to try the ADULT milkshakes next time.,3,1,2
I was in town visiting and stopped by this place due to their happy hour sign. I am glad I stoped in. I sat at the bar and had a good bartender who made a great gin and vermouth cocktail. Their happy hour lasts until 7pm.,3,5,2
"ok, no offense to anyone, but what is up with the guy who works there with the painted on groucho marx style eyebrows and the humongous wild west mustache? i am intrigued. At any rate, the people watching is excellent in their outside eating area and the atmosphere is great inside as well. I have only been here for drinks, but seriously, on the drinks tip - who has wine glasses with a ring to signify the alcohol portion? we are all adults here and if someone gets more than 2 oz. a glass the world is not going to end. So lighten up Caribou Cafe haven't you ever heard the saying, a day without wine is like a day without sunshine?",3,5,2
"I had read so many good reviews about this place and had been planning to visit for so long. Finally we went there today. We walked in late Sunday afternoon. We were greeted on the entrance and our host asked me if we had a reservation... I didn't know that we needed a reservation. He looked at me and said he might be able to get us a table outside. I looked in the restaurant and only 40 percent of the tables were occupied. Anyways, we were seated Inside after 5 minutes. I don't know what was his concerns. ..The inside decor is lovely. It feels like inside of Pottery barn. The service was slowish even though they were not that busy. I ordered Funghi pizza and baked eggs. Let me say this, it was the most delicious flat bread pizza I ever had. Wow. It really made up for the slow service and everything. The baked eggs were ok. We were also given complimentary bread basket to soak with the olive oil. We loved the food. The drinks were ok but were Pricey. In the end I ordered macaroons. We had coconut and pistachio flavors. Coconut was very sweet but the pistachio was perfect. You can try different types of olive oils on your way back or waiting for a table. And you may end up buying one :)",5,3,2
"Being from Los Angeles, I have only experienced california type pizza, nothing too special, but I still like it. Now when I lived in Center City/South Philly for almost two years, junk food was pretty normal . Cheese Steaks, Pizza, Pizza Fries, Pizza Steaks, Cheese Steak Eggrolls from the dirty fast food chinese place that serves you through a bullet proof glass window. Whats not to like? All bad for you, yet so good. When some local friends took me to Lorenzos, I was hooked, the first bite you take, you know its an authentic real east coast pizza. 2 slices of cheese and a coke. I am set. the price went up I think, but not bad of a price to pay when you come out of a bar on south street at midnight drunk and want something to eat. Lorenzos is one of the places i'll always remember about Philly.",4,2,2
"The customers that can't handle the iPad ordering style should have moved on instead of faulting the establishment for it. While the style is certainly different, it's rather innovative in that: 1) you're only bothered by staff when you want 2) there's no crowded bars to fight through to get a drink 3) you're in complete control of your experience While the system defaults to upcharges (that's capitalism folks), it's rather obvious how to change that. I certainly would never go out of my way to eat here, but it's more than fine while waiting for a flight. There's also charging stations at ever seat. For the price of a glass of wine (or whatever you want), this certainly beats waiting at the gate.",3,1,2
"The service is exceptional. Attentive and patient. My burger, which I was so looking forward to from my last experience, was disappointing. I ordered medium rare. It was not rare, and was barely medium. The escargot and Brussel sprouts were very good, although the portions were rather small.",4,2,2
"decent nachos.. from what I recall also I think they were very accommodating of all us yelpers who stormed in post the JGD elite event.. the waitress was attentive... and I like that... also it's right across from 30th street, and the football game was on . what else could I have asked for at the time?",3,1,2
We had a 7:30 reservation but were not seated until 8:30. We were told that other parties had arrived late but that is not in excuse. The food was good but the wait was ridicul. I would not go back due to this.,3,1,2
"I woke up super early with a couple friends and made the 8:30am walk to try Dottie's for the first time! I kept forgetting the donuts are vegan, but they are genuinely a bit lighter than your average donut! I recommend mixing classics with deluxes; I wish we picked a classic glazed. We ended up eating them in Clark Park, and it was a great start to the day! A little breakdown: lemon poppy: 3/5 pleasant but artificial tasting cinnamon sugar: 4/5 cookie butter: 5/5 apple fritter: 3/5 too sweet and too much frosting",3,5,2
"This place was not the cleanest, but it certainly was not as dirty as some other patrons complained. The banh mi was amazing -- I got the tofu one, and it was so flavorful! I also got a box of the fried flower cookies. I told the cashier it was fine to put them in the same bag, but she was so concerned over the possibility of me breaking one of their finely crafted cookies. The prices are very reasonable. I am coming back here for sure!",5,3,2
"I got a menu from Isabella on my door knob. Called several times for pizza delivery. Delivery is always fast. Last night I decided to go in for take out. I like to see where I'm ordering from (not all restaurants are clean). Instead of pizza, I went for a steak hoagie and meatball & spaghetti. Both dishes were good and only cost a total of $21.00 compare to the other pricey restaurants in the area. DON'T- I tried their wings twice and do not like the wings. I had the plain un-breaded and roasted garlic butter. THE WINGS HAVE NO TASTE and NO SEASONING.",3,1,2
"Good Ameri-Chinese food! I enjoyed the Chicken Chow Mein and bestie ordered shrimp egg foo young. The latter was good, but i preferred the Chicken Chow Mein- it was all white meat and the vegetables were thick cut and very flavorful . Prices aren't bad and delivery fee is low. I would order the chow mein again but I don't think I'm an egg foo young fan though I think it was well prepared. There was a mixup with my order - though I ordered the Shrimp Chow Mein, I received Chicken Chow Mein. But just a simple phone call to the restaurant triggered a reimbursement of the difference. The manager asked me how I wanted it handled and was very polite and customer oriented. I appreciated that very much! So in spite of receiving the incorrect order I still enjoyed it very much and wasn't annoyed in the least :)",5,3,2
"I love the food at Kensai, but they charge you for the little cups of sauce and they don't even fill them a quarter of the way up. I have asked them in the past to please fill them all the way and they told me they can't because ""they are pre packaged.""",3,1,2
"Great food, cucumbers almost better than Han. Dry pepper chicken was really great, probably better than Han. 2 complaints. The plates are terrible for rice and chopsticks. They're oval with a relatively big curve at the edge which makes it nearly impossible to scoop sauce drenched rice. Dry clumps of rice are easy but I had to literally hold the plate and tilt it the whole time I was eating. Secondly and a serious pet peeve of mine, is packing the rest of my food to go. I'm fine if they do it but I watched as the bartender scooped the remainder of my dry fry chicken into a to go container in a rushed manner and at least 2 pieces of chicken didn't make it into my box. Well why the F not? Really very annoying. Anyway, GREAT food and lovely atmosphere. I'll be back but will ask to pack my own leftovers and hope they get more drenched rice friendly plates!",4,2,2
Went to El Fuego for lunch and had the best hard shell Chicken Taco! The staff are very pleasant. I recommend you go. Delicious!,3,5,2
"Philly,PA I cant believe I forgot to review this place! PROS. : Open Late. Plain steak is okay. This is awesome to find this spot when the other spot down Front & Oregon is closed and you are starving late night!!!!",3,5,2
"Price: 2 Ambience: 5 Food: 5 Service: 5 Flavor: 4 Pro-tip: if you have a large enough group, ask for a private room, the service is even better. Joined some colleagues for lunch. I ordered their salmon with a cup of clam chowder. They were both good. The salad was ample and the flavor was juicy and delicious. The clam chowder was ok. The service was impeccable. Young guy, very attentive and professional. His professionalism and service commitment really enhanced the meal. I would return.",5,3,2
"Lot's of friendly staff, working the dine in and take out lines. So far so good. I had to try the famous roast pork sandwich with sharp provolone and broccoli rabe. Made popular by the numerous videos on YouTube. Size portion is big. This sandwich can feed two hungry people. I had half and took half home. Now for the taste. It's good. The melted provolone mixed with the rabe and pork on the Italian roll. It's a meaty, a little bitter from the broccoli rabe, messy drippy onto the bun. Unique texture of tastes. It's good. For sure. Not mind blowing though.",3,5,2
"This restaurant was ok. Service was nice and helpful. My wife had the charcuterie/cheese board, and she LOVED it. I had the fried chicken. The pancake that it came with was delicious, and the chicken was moist and had a great batter. The honey that came on the side with the chicken was delicious. The only problem was that there was absolutely no salt in the fried chicken batter. Since everything else was good, I'm guessing that someone accidentally missed the step in the recipe where you put salt in the batter. We'll definitely give this place another shot.",3,5,2
"The coffee here isn't anything superb, but the service is great. The place is small, but clean and modern looking. I was greeted as soon as I walked in and asked how I can be helped. Friendly service on a Monday morning was a good start to the day.",3,5,2
You get what you're going for! It's a super themed bar. Decorated to the T. Drinks are expensive but they're also themed and very on-brand for the bar. You go for the experience.,5,3,2
"It is 8 am, an hour after Bodhi is supposed to open and it is still closed. This has become a very frequent and frustrating problem. Society Hill and Headhouse area need a good and reliable coffee shop. Sadly Bodhi no longer fits the bill. La Colombe where are you??",3,1,2
After my hair cut I decided to stop by on this cold day...the soup dumplings was one of the best I had in philly so far. The skin was thin to the point that I can see half the dumpling filled with juices. The staff was nice and the prices were fair. I'm sure I will find myself here again.,3,5,2
"Strong 4, close to 5. Very accommodating - they quartered my requested toppings even though they typically won't. Not the cheapest pie around but not close to the most expensive and the superior ingredients are easily recognizable in the flavor. Only had the Grandma and it was close to being worth the 40 minute wait. I second the calls for a phone or online ordering option. All in all, worth the wait for quality pizza.",4,2,2
"Right off the bat, 5 stars for cleanliness.That might be strange thing to start with when there's so much to be said about the food, but everything on that table was just so clean! I'm so sick and tired of sitting down for breakfast at even a ""good"" restaurant table where the condiments are grimy, the menus are sticky, or the silverware is stained. Here, everything gleamed. A good start. That being said, we had a perfectly delicious meal. My friend ordered matza ball soup and potato pancakes. I ordered a toasted onion bagel with whitefish salad, cream cheese, lettuce, tomato, and onion; and potato pancakes. We both ordered coffee. It's been said a bunch of times how huge the portions are. It's no joke. I couldn't finish even a half of my sandwich. I would have liked to because the whitefish salad was so fresh and full of lovely, little chunks of fish. I took half home with me. Fifteen dollars for a sandwich is a splurge for me, but given the divine taste and the fact that it was 2-meals size, it was worth every penny. My friend felt the same way about her soup. She kept saying, ""I'm too full,"" but she kept eating that soup. She did leave a little behind. The coffee was good. Coffee preferences are personal. I like a mild cup of coffee. So, I thought the coffee was good, maybe even delicious. Did we just get lucky getting such an attentive server, or all the wait staff so good at their job? I don't know. This was my first visit. I just know we had a great waiter. He was attentive but not intrusive. He brought my friend milk for her coffee without being asked because he overheard me asking her if she wanted creamer and she said, no, she usually used milk. He brought me a take-out box and plastic bag without me asking. He kept an eye on our coffee. He patiently answered our questions. A great server for newbies like us. We had no wait for a table at 9:45 am on a Sunday, but by the time we left, all the tables were full. I wouldn't have minded if we had had to wait though. For something like this, I would wait. On the way out, I picked up a half dozen bagels and some whitefish salad to take back to Western Maryland with me where we don't have great bagels or fresh whitefish salad. I must say how much I appreciated that the lady put my onion bagels in a different bag from my plain bagels.",5,3,2
"Not coming back until they turn down the horrible ""music."" I think the food and service were excellent but I could not hear the conversation nor properly digest. Please get rid of the unnecessary noise!",3,1,2
"My rating is actually a 3/4 star, but it might be what was ordered. Going to Capital Grille, I was expecting some sort of a superior meal, it was not, but at the same time, it was not one of your other Joe Schmoe types of restaurant either. On a note for getting dressed up, I don't think that's the case. I believe you just need to be presentable. I went there with a polo shirt, shorts, and flip flops, FAR from being ""dressed up"". This place is a steakhouse, and it feels like a steakhouse. We enjoyed a glass of Pinot Noir by Angeline of Sonoma-Mendocino County, and it was quite tasty. It went nicely with the Porterhouse and the Steak Tenderloin that we ordered. Originally we wanted to share the 24oz Porterhouse, 2 appetizers and sides, but thought a particular dish had this really nice lobster that was presented at the next table (Seared Tenderloin with buttered Poached Lobster). It was not what they ordered, so we were disappointed. (Maybe next time we should ask). The 24oz Dry Aged Porterhouse Steak was a HEFTY portion, The size of it looked bigger than my head. Albeit, I'm a 5'3 Asian Girl, I'm not sure any one person can really finish that piece. It wasn't just all meat and no flavor neither, it was one of the better slabs of steak I've had thus far. My only concern was I had it medium, and certain parts were medium well whereas other parts were medium rare. It doesn't matter, it was still good. The Steak Tenderloin however was not ""tender"". It was rather tough and dry. We ordered it medium on that as well. It sat on a scoop of mash potatoes and drizzled with a few pieces of frozen lobster chunks. The initial look down ran the though ""I paid $46 for this? It looks like something microwaved."" It was nice that one of the managing waiters? came by to check on how things were going and packed our leftovers up for us. We were offered dessert and the Souffle did look yummy, however, we were stuffed. On a side note, it was a little strange that our waiter kept offering us tequila. This a nice steakhouse restaurant, but I believe there is better to be had. My next stop, Barclay Prime, and hopefully at that time, I can give a better comparison for steakhouses in Philadelphia.",4,2,2
Can't go to Philly and not get a Philly cheese steak! Service is great and fast. Fries are amazing! Not too soggy not crispy. The fries are just right! It only got 3 stars because as a repetitive customer they are not as favorable as they used to be. But it's definitely one of my Philly faves.,3,5,2
"After walking into the South Street location, we knew we had to leave. The super long line, overabundance of Midwestern tourists and autographs of annoying people on the wall (i.e. Ann Heche) made me uncomfortable. This didn't feel like the real thing. We knew Pat's and Geno's were tourist traps but didn't expect Jim's to be like that. It was. We needed to flee. All I could hear in my head was ""Innnnnnnn West Philadelphia, born and raised...."" and I knew we needed to head towards the original Jim's. We made a quick call (from the line at Jim's on South -- just in case) to make sure they were open (Labor Day) and indeed they were. Let's roll. We made it to Jim's on 62nd without too much drama . A few block parties caused interesting re-routes that gave us a taste of the neighborhood. I don't know Philadelphia and I don't know you, but I felt safe enough. Hell, after walking into Jim's I felt like I'd never need to leave! I knew as soon as we started chatting with the employees inside that this place was getting 5-stars. Not an attitude to be found, they made our steak with mushrooms and whiz an event to be remembered with their suggestions and sweet smiles. I'm all for ketchup, salt and pepper, by the way. Just thinking about it again makes my mouth water. The bread was top notch, not the least big soggy even after we transported part of one back to Annapolis (4 meals in one day can be tough for even ME to pull off). Philadelphia is a city full of rich history -- don't let the fact that this is Jim's original location and that they use the same grill that was installed in 1939 get lost on you. This is the real deal. Oh and the prices are lower than the South Street location. So take that Anne Heche. Now I know why the Fresh Prince was begging and pleading with mom day after day not to have to kick it in Bel-Air. He must have known about Jim's.",5,3,2
"Great location, good service, clean facilities, great ambiance, lovely people, internet is relatively fast. Coffee is good but nothing special. I would equate with Starbucks with prices to match. Very, very loud! If you want to study or conduct business, this place is not for you. Music is every where. You can't escape it. You can hear it through the headphones.",1,3,2
"Went for NYE with a large group which obviously is an aggravating experience no matter what. I didn't pick the restaurant but apparently my friends didn't know they had a preset menu for NYE ....i was fine with that but apparently they were serving the rest of the menu at the bar not the tables for some reason. Our bill ended up being around $100 per person and we asked the staff if we could split it evenly on 8 cards and they said we could only put 2 cards. I know this might be a poor person aggravation rather than their normal clientele's but i for sure could not put $400 on my card let alone almost $800. While the food was decent, I really was going more for the company so it sucked that half of the people had sour moods post dinner.",3,1,2
"Went there to day drink, it was a good time. Burgers were simple, but good.",5,3,2
"atmosphere is great, whether in winter when you can sit by the lovely french doors, or in warmer months when it's all open to the sidewalk. As a tea drinker and pastry eater, though, I've got to give this place lower marks than local spots like the Chapterhouse or even starbucks-- muffins are often stale, tea is not particularly strong or high quality. Go shopping at the Tea House folks!",3,5,2
"I always get the turkey breast with mushrooms on original wheat for breakfast. No lines in the morning. Lunch for breakfast. This review is currently shorter than most...oh well. The food is good, period.",5,3,2
"I really like this place,it's by no means fancy however the food is good and reasonably priced. I always found the 2 women that worked the counter very nice and accommodating. They always have a Christian music station on, it's not offensive just background noise.my point is they truly come from a good place and show their Christianity in the way they care for the customers. Gotta try it.",5,3,2
"The slices are freaking huge, they're only $3 and they're open super late. The slices are less amazing when you're sober though...",3,5,2
"We went there for an early family dinner. Ordered the samosas, chicken tikka masala, kadai lamb, tandoori chicken, naan and mango lassi. The entrees were on the spicy side, especially the lamb. We like spicy so it suited us well. The sauces were very flavorful, nothing was bland. The seasoning on the tandoori chicken was spicy so the kids couldn't eat it. Wish we could bring our own food to Indian restaurants for the kids.",4,2,2
Came for a bday dinner. Great for smaller groups or groups with same dietary restrictions. Will come back with smaller group. Food was great and broths were delicious. Go with people who eat everything.,3,5,2
"Just not my favorite burgers. Most people love it, but I've never been thrilled. Great people, beer, and tots. I wish I liked it more.",3,5,2
"I chose to try ordering this poke through delivery. Perhaps I had higher expectations because I had poke out west in California which was exponentially better. The bowl was small and was filled primarily with rice. Only the top layer comprised the rest of the ingredients which were not necessarily bad, I would say they were average. The single star was given primarily because the bowl was 70% cheap white rice. My overall impression is that this place is fine for people who have never had poke and want to try something new. With that being said, for anyone who has had good (or even decent) poke before, beware: this will undoubtedly fall short of your expectations.",1,3,2
"I've been here 3 times before and always loved it, especially the coconut soup and mango sticky rice, but this time I'm pretty sure my boyfriend and I got food poisoning, either from the pad thai or pork dumplings.",3,5,2
Good food. Horrible service. Diners are normally known for the same plain jane foods which is what I looked for and found going here. But where the hell is my server? And side of fries? And water! Step up the game please!!,3,1,2
"OK so you all know Joey mack is gone place is closed permanetly. The Pizza was ok consider the price and the polace just was filthy. THE Cheese that macks pizza specaial is white cheaddar wisconsin cheese more expensive than the blah mozzarello. Any way whaever Mack told you was a stone faced lie. HE cash in store $1000'[s and the bank next door had huge account with $10,000 - $20,000 in in it. I'm not sure but word was he passed away.

Read reports of all troubles now it's not safe.",3,1,2
"Delicious, but... I ordered 2 Manhattan sandwiches and a combo plate with Falafel, Hummus, Feta Cheese, Salad and Rice, and Baba Ganouj. My vegetarian friend got pretty ill from eating the Manhattan sandwich. We chalked it up to coincidence and ate the Combo plate the following day and again felt ill. My friend suggested it was a similar feeling to when eating something that was cross-contaminated with some sort of meat. I received a reply that new processes have been put in place to prevent cross-contamination, which gives me the confidence to return.",4,2,2
"Delicious food and top notch service. I'm not sure why we waited so long to try this place. Maybe part of the reason I was blown away by the food/service here, was that I had no expectations going in? Who knows. What I do know is that I left full and very, very happy. Edamame dumplings, char grilled aged beef (cooked medium, and cooked perfectly), wasabi mashed potatoes, and vegetable rice were allllll delicious. We also had the pan seared sea bass which was very good, and cooked very well, but I liked the other items more. That's just my personal preference. Desserts were good, but not the shining stars. Just writing this review makes me want to go back...",5,3,2
great place to grab a beer with the buddies and watch the game. nice setting and great bar service :D,3,5,2
Good appetizers. Boring experience. Bad Sushi. Weird Japanese holographic image up front. Not the friendliest staff. I am not spending my money here again. Why? Doesn't resonate with my idea of a chilled out evening and I also realized that I do truly hate Sake.,3,1,2
"Mediocre food and bad service; very disappointed! I meant a colleague here for lunch. I was very interested to try it considering how often I have gone by this place. She had been here in the past and recommended it. Inside it was pretty empty. We sat outside at the only table available since the weather was really nice. We waited for what felt like a long time until the waitress ran by us. We had to flag her down a couple of times to get our order in. I ordered the crab and Singapore noodle salad, and my colleague ordered a salad and the tofu satay. My salad came out to be about the size of a half side salad with lettuce, noodles, and about 2 tablespoons worth of semi frozen crab meat. There really wasn't much to it but we had trouble getting the waitress to come back with another menu so that I could order more food. I eventually decided that I would just eat more food somewhere else. For a salad that cost $7.50 I would have expected a bit more food or something else like more veggies with it.",1,3,2
Baked goods not fresh. Pricing is hit or miss.,1,3,2
"Good food as always, no matter what I get. The only thing that I didn't like is that they don't have homemade lemonade anymore But everything else is good",5,3,2
"Solid chicken Pho! I was excited when I saw this location had opened because as someone who doesn't eat beef, there aren't many good Pho options for me in the city. The menu is limited here, but that's fine by me! I like places that only do one thing and do them right. My husband walked in and ordered while I waited outside. I also got a Vietnamese coffee and they asked him if I wanted it for now or with the food. He got it made immediately, so I sipped it outside while we waited. It was sweet, creamy, and delicious! The food was ready in about 15 minutes. Everything was packaged separately and nicely so your noodles don't get soggy. They will ask you if you want the noodles steamed or not. I got mine steamed since I would be eating it soon. However, if you have a longer distance to travel it's good to have the unsteamed option. I also only like white meat chicken so we asked for white meat only. My husband likes dark meat but he wasn't sure about all the innards so he played it safe too on our first visit. I'll definitely be back! This is comfort food but also something I don't feel too unhealthy eating.",5,3,2
"Lol ... I placed my order through Grubhub (2 cheesesteaks , 2 orders of cheese fries with the cheese on the side (yelp tip) and a Pepsi ). The order was delivered in a timely manner, the food was hot and pretty tasty but they called grub hub to charge me an additional $0.11 for two sides of cheese instead of on the fries. Lol. $0.11 really, not $0.10 or $0.12 but $0.11.",3,1,2
"This place is beautiful. The food is quality, but the worst was that it took 3 hours for us to finish our dinner. They were the slowest restaurant I've ever been to in my life. By the end of hour 2 they stopped refilling our waters. Just to be clear, we ordered cocktails, appetizers, and a main course. How could that take so long!? The Ritz is cool but i might not come back. Sorry.",3,1,2
"Been going here my whole life (31 years) I even had a birthday party here when I was a kid. Sure it's not Lombardi's in Manhattan, Denino's in Staten Island, Bruni's in Hammonton. Pepe's in New Haven. But then again it is also no where near there price's. Also don't forget Station is easily easiiiiiiiily better than any chain shop (Domino's, Pizza Hut, Little Caesars, Papa John's etc) At around $7 for a large plain it's a great price. I have been to Italy as well (Rome, Florence, Venice) I can honestly say Station still beats any pizza I had there.",3,5,2
"it's a take-out -- mainly -- chinese joint on south street. it's not supposed to be gourmet, so what it does, it does well. and the lay at the counter is sweet as can be. plus, there's no delivery charge, and your food is always at your door pretty close to pronto, as in less than half an hour after the order. and though they don't take amex, they make up for it by adding freebies into some deliveries, like drinks and even a full entree now and again. still, we, as chinese food eaters, need to ask for more! white meat, for starters. and fortunes cookies every time, at least one per entree. sure, it's this way everywhere, so if you want plain and simple chinese food and post-chinese food bloat afterwards, go for it; it's near the top for that. but i want healthy, white meat sesame chicken, and i intend to find it! who's with me?",2,4,2
"I love this place, the tall lager is HUGE and it's real fun to go with a couple of friends. I don't think I'd go there alone because I'd find it boring.",5,3,2
Most recently we hit CM on a saturday afternoon for lunch. The place was pretty quiet as usual in the afternoon. Ordered up a couple of Margherita pizzas.....some of the best you can get anywhere in NE Phila and surrounding suburbs. 8 or 10 visits now under our belt and I still could not tell you about anything else on the menu....The service and decor are fine (nothing to rave or complain about). The pizza is the real star here. I cannot anyone not being impressed.,5,3,2
"After moving to PA, I made it my personal mission to go to Philly for the famous cheesesteaks. After reading many reviews I decided to go to Geno's over Pat's. Forced my friends to road trip from Allentown to Philly with the sole mission of having cheesesteaks. It was a cold winter night and I was completely unaware that Geno's did not have indoor seating. After an 1 hour and change of traveling we arrived to quickly order our food (be prepared and know the lingo or you will get attitude) and eat in the car. I got a cheesesteak with wiz. I personally didn't think it was bad, but definitely didn't think it was amazing. The company I was with was not a fan and definitely did not think it was worth the journey. They found it overpriced and was not aware that it was cash only. Everyone agreed the bread was good, but that's about it. If I was in the philly area I would probably go again, but since I don't, I probably won't be going there again. Peace and cheesesteak grease, Domi B.",2,4,2
A little dirtier than Midtown 2 - but the same basic old-skool diner vibe. Good for breakfasts and cheap dinners. It is creepy though - but my 5 year old loves to get one pancake and one scrambled egg here.,2,4,2
"We've been ordering takeout from A Lin for quite some time now and it's usually really good. We've noticed that the food is better after 5 pm for some odd reason. Maybe it's a different and better cook in the evening hours. When we ordered lunch it always tastes different than when ordered after about 5pm. The food is usually really tasty . I've never posted a review even though we do like eating here. They always deliver within the time they post on Grub Hub and it's always hot and they have never messed up the order or forgot something. We just now only order after 5 pm. . I'm writing this review because last night it was raining and it was a Friday night so we kinda figured it would take longer than the 45 minutes it usually takes, and it it took much longer. An hour and half. I had to call twice to see what was going on with our order. They finally showed up and amazingly it was still hot! But for the first time they forgot something. They forgot one of the sauces that comes with the crab Rangoon, which is the best crab Rangoon takeout in this whole city! But it's just not the same without the sweet sauce! So I called them and told them that it wasn't in the bag. I asked if they could bring it to me and they said ok. So I figured it would take a long time. To my surprise they showed up about 10 minutes later with the sauce and a whole new order of crab Rangoon! It wasn't even the driver, it was the girl I spoke to on the phone. I can't believe they did that. So shocked and pleased because We really love their food at A Lin Kitchen. They get 10 from us!",4,2,2
"I don't really have great things to say about Ants Pants, but I also don't have many bad things to say either. It's just...forgettable. First, it's cash only, as are most places in this area. The wait for brunch on the weekends is insane and in my opinion, not worth it. You can probably make many of their menu items at home, and save yourself some money too. While the decor is cute and my mom loved the granola and yogurt (which is near $7...highway robbery!), I'd suggest walking down the street to Honey's or Resurrection. You might have to wait a bit longer, but it will be worth it.",2,4,2
"I loooooooove their grilled chicken with rice platter. There is no bone in the chicken, just how I like it. The fish sauce is just PERFECT. I found the pho to be average as any other places. The coffee was OK. Ever since experiencing coffee at Cafe Saigon in Adam's Ave Plaza, I've been pretty picky. The service is not bad. They don't come up to you and ask if there's anything else you need (Asian restaurants usually don't), but if you needed anything, they were quick to respond.",5,3,2
"Excellent. Top notch REAL Mexican food. Fresh, authentic. Reasonable prices. Would definitely go back.",3,5,2
"Stupidly expensive. Everything is a la carte, and honestly, just average burgers. The staff have no idea what's on the menu...",1,3,2
"I had this place bookmarked as a ""must try"" for Caribbean food in Philly. So, I knew I would give in to my oxtail desires this week and it just so happens I had time to stop by Ron's today. I placed an order over the phone for a small oxtail platter with rice, peas, and cabbage. I also ordered a small jerk chicken platter with rice, peas, and string beans. Upon completion of my order, I was given a number and asked for my name. Upon arriving to the restaurant I noticed people standing all over the place. There was a barrier where people were supposed to stand, but no one was behind the barrier. I spoke to a fellow customer and he told me I needed to go up to the window and see if my food was ready. I stood there watching a woman call out random names then people would walk up to the window. Wow, talk about unorganized. Approximately 10 mins later, the woman returned to the window and asked if people wanted to check and see if there orders were ready. I gave my name and number. She closed the window and then I stood there for another 15 mins. Mind you, I drove from Jersey, which took 45 mins. So, between the 45 min drive, standing in the sun to approach the window, and standing around to get my food, I was over the experience. I kept thinking, ""if I just get my food and it's good, I'll be ok."" My name was finally called. I paid $26 and left. Well, I drove back to Jersey to try my food. The platters were heavy, so there was a lot of food. Everything looked good, so that was great. We tried items from both platters. My food review is below. The good: Platters were filled with food. There was lots of gravy for the oxtails, rice & peas. The not so good: My jerk chicken tasted just like my oxtails. The jerk sauce didn't really taste like jerk sauce and the chicken wasn't spicy. I don't know if someone poured the same gravy over the meat on both platters, but I didn't enjoy the gravy at all. The oxtails were just ok. I have had much better in and out of Philly. The cabbage was ok and the string beans were tasteless. Overall, I would not return to Ron's Caribbean Cuisine bc Kingston Philly is a much better option. Guess, I will drive the extra 4 mins to go there next time.",3,1,2
"Got the Beyond Meat burger with a collard wrap, I love the wrap idea. Much better than using lettuce. They must use the refrigerated version of the burger as it had a very different look and taste than the frozen variation I've had before. But while I love the frozen one, I didn't like this one at all. The taste was very offputting, didn't taste like a real burger as the frozen ones do. And it was ""bloody"". That's from the beet juice used to give it its color but I did not like this at all. Not sure if cooking it ""well done"" would take this away but I suspect it would as around the edges were fine for the most fine part. They should let you know this is how it's made before ordering. I ate around the edges where it wasn't bleeding only and threw the rest away, it was that bad. I won't order this again. I hope management reconsiders and goes with the frozen version which gives a much better taste. I had ordered delivery and the fries arrived cold, nothing is done to them to preserve any heat at all. The one shining star...the vegan coconut milkshake with avocado! WOW!!! This was one of the best tasting shakes I've had in my life. Amazing!!!!",4,2,2
Great sandwiches for cheaper than average prices in Manayunk!,5,3,2
Review is on beer only. Rated in a pint scale. 0-5 of how many pints I could drink in an evening. I didn't try the ipas as I'm not a fan. Bohemian blonde: crisp light and refreshing. Slight bitterness on the finish. 4 pints. Manayunk lager: smooth creamy nice maltiness. 4 pints Schuykill punch: raspberry lager. Light crisp tart raspberry flavor. 5 pints Lock 70: oatmeal stout. Smokehouse toasted oats. Light in body for a stout. 4 pints. Grand cru: slight tartness. Not a typical red ale. 3 pints.,5,3,2
"Amazing in theory, and very abundant in potential! but do to a vast number of reasons Night Market just completely failed to deliver. But since it was very apparent that they were test driving the first one before (hopefully) sending out a more well oiled version next year; and because this event has been heavy on feedback and suggestions, I'm more than happy to break it down for them as best I can. And since it looks like my 6:30 arrival clocked me in at arriving sooner than everyone else who hooked up a review, I might just be able to add a little more extended insight. Break it down! Variety - Since the first food options I immediately noticed were three flavors of taco, ceviche, savory crepes, gelato, and cupcakes; it looked more like a Latin food and dessert fest rather than a market that celebrated the ultimate diversity of Philly's food culture. Since my tooth feeling partially sweet at the time, I've had the benefit of enjoying Honest Tom's on way too many wonderful weekends; and because I boycotted Coup De Taco when they were rocking the Entourage, my selections were pretty easy. But I could easily understand why so many people could be disappointed by such an atrocious lack of variety. When I think of Food Trucks I normally think beyond the tacos and see Middle Eastern at the Falafel Truck and Rami's, vegetarian at Magic Carpet, hot dogs at Dapper Dog, Korean at Koja, and then some, and when I think of South Philly I normally think of one of the most diverse epicenters of food Philly has to offer. So considering both its pretty easy to see how they could have extended the whole market at least by a whole extra block for options. Over hyped, under delivered - When you talk up an event as Night Market was talked up you can already expect to be prepared for a crap ton of people. And when you hype it up even more so after a rain delay extends the wait a week, you can expect those masses to be double with anticipation. When you work with restaurants who are generally used to keeping their food within their element, and food trucks that are generally used to working within a set spot for a set amount of hours; it's generally up to you to communicate that they should expect those masses, and help them figure out how they might be able to come better prepared for it. And that was something that clearly missed its mark by a longshot. But despite those two heavily waited flaws all wasn't that lost. When food was had it was enthusiastically savored. as always Attia Taylor's music was pretty hot. and it was great to see local businesses like Green Aisle Grocery and and the garden store involved. So while the kinks in the armor where ABUNDANTLY clear, Night Market did sustain enough of a minor victory to constitute another few good attempts at becoming even more of a winner. So here's looking at 2011!",3,5,2
"The food is great, but why, why, why doesn't the waitress write down the order? Ours was wrong, waited for food, ruined the experience. We won't think any less of you, I promise. Write the order down!!!",3,1,2

"This place felt like Rapeville. You may not find a lot of love up in this particular club, but you'll probably find a lot of herpes and regret.",1,3,2
Creative take on sushi and other Japanese fare. I sat at the drinks bar which - oddly - was in the basement. For me the most memorable parts of the meal were the octopus sampler (very tasty octopus slices skewered together and cooked simple by adding hot oil flavored with spices - awesomely tender!) and the Double Knot cocktail similar to a Manhattan but with the addition of barrel stave smoke. The smoky aroma really added to the cocktail for me. The hamachi sampler was fine but not as interesting.,5,3,2
"My friend and I went to misconduct the night of ""Outfest"" and Sunday Football, so we knew they would be busy, but we got a table right away. We had two waitresses, not sure why, but both very friendly. We ordered an appetizer and after a long wait the one waitress informed us that they were out of that appetizer and that she had another appetizer on its way and said as an apology she would put a round of drinks on the house! We weren't upset about the app taking long, so this was just an added bonus! Our meals ended up coming out before our app but again, no big deal. My burger was way over cooks, and thats when I realized no one ever asked me what temp i wanted it cooked at. Again, they were busy. So not a big deal. So over all, I give it 4 stars because the hiccup with the app and the overcooked burger, but the staff was very nice and apologetic so it all ended up fine.",4,2,2
"The decor and atmosphere is perfect for the fare. You can't go wrong with the selection of food---but pick accordingly. I LOVED the memphis style ribs, the fried green tomatoes and the delicious whipped yams that taste like they're made with a TON of molasses. The cornbread is rich and velvety and the hush puppies are perfect. Also wonderful is that they always have a beer special. Service is prompt and friendly. A few things are lacking: cole slaw, potato salad, and the collard greens. It's definitely worth the trip if you're into bbq but it's a bit disappointing that they don't have a pork hotlink.",3,5,2
"Are here again and actually got the pizza and a small buffalo chicken Stromboli. The pizza was actually hearty with a contradictory thin crust. Quality cheese and a hearty dough with texture on the bottom it was really good. I think the Stromboli stole the show. Excellent. Fresh dough, perfect spiciest level, oozing with mozz. Highly recommend",3,5,2
"I've gone here a few times and tried the regular and Kobe beef burgers. I would say it's better than five guys or Shake Shack in terms of meat quality, plus they have some interesting sauces....if they actually give them to you. If you customize your own burger make sure you check that you got the toppings and sauce you wanted, A couple of times I came home with my burger only to find that I was missing those key ingredients that make the burger. At which point I was too lazy to put my pants back on and go outside, leaving me no choice but to begrudgingly eat said burger sauceless. I've gotten a different person every time I ordered, one thing they did have in common is that they had no idea what any of their own sauces or toppings were. If the staff had a little training and cared about getting your order right this place would be great. As it is, I think I'll save myself a dollar or two and go somewhere else for a quick bite.",2,4,2
"The worst burger I have ever had in my life. Don't get a burger even if it's for free. That being said, this is a good place to hang out with friends and grab some drinks. This is an old pub and it has a great chill vibe. Drinks, but NOT food.",3,1,2
"Ahhhh Zorba's. I've been longing to try Zorba's deliciousness for a long, long time since I run past literally 6 days a week. A friend and fellow yelper gave it a glowing review and with family in town for the weekend I knew it was going to be a top choice when deciding on a place to eat. Let me first start with the food: amazeballs. We started with the hot appetizer of squid, calamari and octopus. The calamari was perfectly breaded and fried to perfection. The octopus and squid were also amazing, with one in a red sauce and the other in a oil and herb sauce. The chicken kebab was perfectly seasoned and full of flavor. The stuffed eggplant dish was melt-in-your-mouth delicious, and since the man-friend practically licked his gyro plate clean I can only imagine it was awesome. Now, let us discuss the service. The hunky young waiter was pretty attentive, but in his failed attempts at flirting with my man-friend's mom (yep, you read that correctly) he came off as kind of a dbag. Let's blame it on the language barrier... Also, they made a big stink over the little nephew's stroller blocking the sidewalk so we had to awkwardly shift our chairs... not sure why they couldn't position our tables differently but that is neither here nor there. Lastly, the man friend asked for more of the delicious tzatziki they serve with the Gyro, since he ate it all [read: I ate it all].... and after about 15 minutes of waiting, we had to ask again. When we got the check we realized they charged us $0.50 for the extra sauce. SAY WHAT?! I know its only $0.50 but when you only get a tiny portion to start out with.... that's just silly.",3,5,2
"Scattered service. First, I asked if I could get a smaller size beer (less than 12 oz) because I was trying to not drink that much. The server told me they could do that and proceeded to give me a 12 oz can! Yikes. I have a dairy allergy and wanted a burger. The server put my order in and 15 min later told me that all the buns had dairy. I asked if I could have it on any other bread. The server called someone who looked like a head chef. He very condescendingly told me my options were no bread or lettuce around the burger. They eventually figured that they could give me pita on the side. This seems like an ok place if you have no specific food needs, but for me, it was not worth the effort. Every single question I asked, the server had to check with the kitchen and the kitchen seemed pretty unaccommodating. Once my food came, my fries came with a sauce with diary! Um....",3,1,2
"My vote: Tourist Trap Others have stated otherwise but on behalf of myself and the 3 others. I have to say this place was not worth the price. The costumes were cute and the staff friendly...But as another reviewer stated: ""The filling [to my turkey pot pie] was a little underwhelming."" The crust was decent but does not make for a $23 dish. The smoked fish appetizer was good. Beer's okay and the spruce/ tree version was not pleasant at all. It's a good conversation topic. My recommendation is to go elsewhere.",1,3,2
"Not Great - DOES NOT SERVE ANY ALCOHOL - Arrived 45 min before close and they made it clear we needed to hurry - Last call for the kitchen is 30 min before close - No alcohol, beer or wine but you can bring your own - Pad Thai was very good - Crispy duck salad was delicious - Shrimp/mushroom soup wasn't very good - Lamb lollipops were over cooked and tough. They refused to cook more for us. Told us we should've known to ask for temperature before they cooked them. Seemed very annoyed that we didn't want them. - They do not have the traditional Thai Spice tray.",3,1,2

Sophie's salad with no dressing every single time. Awesomeness! But to be honest this place kinda eh. Other food doesnt look super great. Kinda pricey for a salad.,3,5,2
"I want to love this place. But two words describe it best: salt bomb. My husband and I have been there 3 times and every single time, no matter what I order, it's super salty. I've had the lamb toast, the grits and the steak salad. If I didn't live so close, I wouldn't have given it so many chances. Kinda looking forward to green eggs opening .",3,5,2
"I always get pleasant quick service which is nice in Reading Terminal. I never feel rushed while here and the price for an iced tea is $1.75 which is very reasonable in my opinion. They will mix in sweetener if you like but it does come black. There is regular sugar along with artificial sugars as well. Overall, I come here a few times a week and never have a problem. If anything I'd like there to be larger sizes for the iced tea as it's so good it's disappointing when it's gone. 10/10 would recommend to a friends or family especially on a hot day.",5,3,2
If we are talking about cannoli this is the place to get the BEST cannoli if you are in South Philly. I have tried MANY cannoli's even in NYC but there's no comparison to any of the other bakeries. I also loved the chocolate ganache praline mousse. I didn't like one type of pastry I forgot what they called though. Pinnacle something like that...it wasn't that good and for the price i had to pay $5 was overpriced. Next time i go there I will only buy cannoli's ......,5,3,2
It's a shame because I keep trying to come back because the foods so good but the service sucks. Every time I've been seated fast it takes a solid 10 minutes for someone to come.,2,4,2
The new & improved Oyster House rocks. It's all modernized & looking spiffy. Can't beat the Happy Hour - oysters are a buck. I could have eaten a few dozen -- but I didn't. Wanted to save some for YOU! All the staff are friendly & helpful - other than the bartender not knowing what kind of plant/flower was sitting on the bar (iris - i found out later). The Oyster House Punch is LETHAL - like a Long Island Ice Tea but WAY BETTER. Chatted it up with Cornell the expert oyster shucker - he was COOL - told him i wanted oyster shucking lessons - he thinks I'm kidding - I'm NOT! See you at the OH...........get there now!,5,3,2
"Second time I ate here was during Harry Potter Festival- over an hour long wait so I find tiny stools at the bar and say ""eh- can we sit here?"" no problem! (really?!) ok, so now I'm totally expecting to be forgotten about for about 20 minutes because it was, well, packed and I makeshift sat us... nope! Prompt, pleasant service with yummy hot food and cold drink on time! I'm not sure how this was humanly possible, no one even gave off the impression of being ""in the weeds"" (and I'm kinda certain I may have even walked through the servers' ""area"" trying to find the restroom!) instead everyone was nice and professional- I mean everyone! Like a utopian society brew pub. (ok, maybe that's a little over the top, but you get the point) Yeah- unnaturally nice people, yummy treats, professional service on a crazy day. Wow. Now, add little egg rolls to your ""small plates"" and change the pepper stuffing from feta to goat cheese and you'll be a 5 start Yelp ;-) Oh, and beer soup!!!! Yes, this exists- smiling people, beer soup and cold pints. Thanks for lunch!",4,2,2
"It's a cheesesteak place pretty much like any other. Perfect steaks for the price. Can't beat them. Some of the best in philly and also within walking distance for pretty much anyone in center city. Service is mildly abrasive but fast and efficient. Sometimes this creates a bit of a compromise on the quality of the steaks but if you come here a few times you'll come out ahead more often than not, and usually that equals a pretty good cheesesteak. The workers aren't exactly the friendliest or the most attentive to your needs but in the end, taste of the food here makes it worth it anyway. The place itself is cool and has some neat pictures on the wall. If you're lucky to grab one of the few seats inside you can hang out and check those out. Don't come here if you're looking for a fancy restaurant style cheesesteak. If you don't eat cart food, these types of places probably aren't for you. They are open pretty late and get a lot of customers so at least there's a good turnover of ingredients and keeps everything fresh. Just remember- cash only, sucka.",3,5,2
"I like the pizza. It's good. Problem: owner is big Trump supporter and isn't shy about engaging customers about it. Not what I want to hear when ordering slices. Owner is just generally abrasive and reprimands his employees in front of customers too. Also, not family friendly at all and that is made clear. No strollers allowed, not even folded up. Gift cards-only good for dining room not takeout pizzas etc...It's too bad because the place potential to be a favorite but just too many turnoffs.",3,1,2
"This was my 4th or 5th time going to Cafe Spice and what I remembered was a great menu with some fun additions and excellent flavors and presentation. While the restaurant still looks great and atmosphere is fun, the food had definitely gone down in both quality and interest. It's very expensive for Indian food and only worth going if you use a restaurant.com gift certificate.",3,5,2
Different take on the cheese steak but delicious overall. The roll is not the average soft Italian bread but stiff and seeded. It worked or I was just hungry... the meat however was rough chop at best and gave a chewy bite. The flavor is on point but don't order fries or onion rings if the line is long. They are gonna be cold by the time the sandwiches are ready. I will return to this old school Philly gem.,5,3,2
Ambiance. Ambiance. Ambiance. This place has it in droves - it's the physical embodiment of bokeh in a bar. I'm stunned that it's not more packed than it is. Be here or be squeeare.,5,3,2
"My husband and I decided to make a last minute brunch reservation this past weekend. We have dined at the Paris bistro on multiple occasions for brunch and dinner. Never have we been so disappointed with both the food and service. Our reservation was made via open table, so when we realized we were running late, we adjusted the time to 2:30. Shortly thereafter, I received a phone call asking if we could come earlier, at 2:15pm. Unfortunately due to our location, we could not. They kept our reservation. Upon arriving at the restaurant, I believe there may have been just 4 other occupied tables. The hostess proceeded to sit us directly in the center of the restaurant, very uncomfortably. My husband inquired as to whether they were closing, but the waiter ensured us that we would not be rushed, and could take our time. We proceeded to order the eggs Benedict and the croque madame. Both of which we have eaten on prior occasions. The croque madame looked like something out of a horror movie. It tasted about average. I was extremely hungry, so I ate it. My husband only ate half of his eggs benedict; told me they were terrible. We ordered a bottle of wine, but decided to take it with us. Quite uncomfortable sitting in an empty restaurant. All in all, it was a bad experience and I don't anticipate we will be back any time soon. It really is a shame, the decor and ambiance is great. And having been to Paris, France, we really enjoyed the restaurant in the past. My recommendation to the restaurant, don't offer a 2:30 reservation if the experience is not appropriate. Quite honestly, we would have eaten somewhere else. Proceed with caution.",3,1,2
"Right, but all the things that people have mentioned---these are things I thought everyone knew, and embraced, before they went to an outing at this international party/event chain. a) You WILL overpay for everything. b) Your kids will sometimes have to fight with drunken 40 year-olds in business suits for a chance to play the cool games. c) You will enjoy yourself despite all of this, because you are a drunken 40 year-old in a business suit. When I get rich, I might go to D&B's to watch sporting events, too. For now, I'll stick to my neighborhood bar.",3,1,2
At first it was cool that they had iPads at each seat. That's where the cool factor pretty much ends. Would be nice if the iPad menu would open up so I could've gotten some breakfast before my next flight. At least they were able to get me a beer. I'll try again next time if I pass this way again.,1,3,2
It's good. Kinda expensive though. Paying over $20 for a pizza is always rough. Also they need to cut their olives into little rings. They just cut them in big sloppy halves.,5,3,2
Food always good some of their waiters are poor. I hate it when a waiter fails to keep your water and ice tea glasses with something in them. I also hate that they clear your dishes while your still eating. Leave me alone and let me eat.,3,1,2
The food is good. I'm not sure why there are gnats flying around though which is a turn off from wanting to eat there. Last time I went there were 5 employees and not one picked up a rag to wipe the dirty tables. I wiped my own table.,3,1,2
"Was 13 miles away at a friend's house when I decided to take a run for a cheesesteak. Did the touristy thing and hit Genos. I totally screwed up the ordering process, but the staff wasn't rude at all. (Didn't see any signs about ordering in English either, but would have shook their hands if I had.). But in the end my steak with onions and provolone wasn't worth the trip. Bread was good and I was happy the meat wasn't that shaved frozen stuff Steak-Uggms. But the short $8.00 thing they handed me wasn't what I would call good. It seemed like a convenience store version of what a cheesesteak is supposed to be. Take heed. The quest for the quintessential steak sandwich continues.",1,3,2
5 stars for a tasty chicken sandwich. Minus 2 for hating gays. Minus 1 for making me feel like a hypocrite since I can't seem to stop eating there.,2,4,2
The food was awesome at tootsies but unfortunately it was so crowded I could barely move through the crowd and I couldn't try food from anywhere else,4,2,2
"Ok I have a love/hate relationship with this place , I been coming here at least 3 times a month for like 2 years and although its a seafood restaurant I also get the steak from time to time and it used to be very good but the last maybe like 5 times I got it its been terrible. I have no clue where they got the managers from but they always look sloppy and lost and never come by to ask how everything is or even come over to the table to apologize when I complain . A high end place like this should have a suited manager who shows interest not a sloppy one with his shirt untucked !",3,1,2
"I had the strawberry shortcake and the presentation definitely gets 5 stars- the pastries here are extremely pretty. They would definitely be good for a gift. However, they just weren't sweet enough for my taste and had a little too much strawberry and not enough cake. But I will definitely be back - everything looks absolutely amazing.",3,5,2
"This is some of the worst Chinese food I've had, unfortunately. The sauce on the sesame chicken was fine, but it was majority breading with very little chicken. We could only eat one or two pieces and had to throw the rest away. We found a pretty sizable hair in the rice. We ordered beef chow mein and it was just beef with onions seeped in sauce - no noodles. We called to say we got the wrong item and they said chow mein isn't noodles (?). We had to throw it out because the beef was so chewy. The scallion pancakes were extremely thick, and no where near what a scallion pancake should be. The spare ribs were probably the best item we ordered but they were fairly dry. I had to give one star because two dishes weren't edible. The food is very inexpensive (around $40 including tip, tax, and delivery fee for 6 items), but I would rather pay a little more for food I can actually eat. I won't return.",1,3,2
"Have walked by this place a million times and finally said, why not?! The wait staff was really nice, the hostess not so much. Built my own burger and it was actually really really great, the side pickles was awesome, sadly the fries and onion rings were just meh (kinda was hoping for a little better there), only complaints were the ketchup and soda were both some all natural gross version of themselves, Ketchup should be Heinz. No exceptions there. Priced as a casual dining restaurant.",4,2,2
"We went there on a Saturday evening (6:00pm) thinking we could try out a new place. As we were approaching the place, we noticed it getting louder and louder. We come upon the stairway and people were everywhere. It looked more like a party than a restaurant. People outside playing beer pong in the middle of the outdoor area, people laid out along the stair entrance smoking cigarettes, and no real organization. Don't get me wrong, we love the beer scene and a good time. However, there was not a staff member in sight. No hostess was anywhere to be found and I'm unsure as to whether there was even a hostess stand. We went inside to ask the bartender where we could sit and he stated, ""Sit anywhere, waitress will get to ya"". Needless to say, we left. I don't know what this restaurant was going for but it wasn't working for me. We love a loud, exciting beer scene but, honestly, this place was not at all welcoming. Maybe go there if you want to get ""wasted"" but for someone trying to get some dinner I probably wouldn't recommend (at least not on the weekend).",1,3,2
"5 for food but 1 for the girl that waited on me and lied. Ordered roast pork with roasted SWEET peppers. Time to pay girl said roasted pork with HOT peppers. Told them should be sweet. She says yes that's way it was written up. Paid. Different girl brought my sandwich. Roast pork with HOT PEPPERS. Told her it was supposed to be SWEET. She turns around to get it fixed and other girl swoops up and says no, it is sweet that they didn't have HOT PEPPERS AT ALL. Guess what peppers were HOT!!!! SHAME on you for lying cause you didn't want to remake a sandwich.",3,1,2
"Food, drinks & karaoke are all good. Crowd is diverse and good vibes. Only problem about this place is the service -- if you call it that or get any at all from rude little ignorant girls that works there.",3,1,2
"Good burgers, good fries, but left me very unhappy having paid $2.25 for a soft drink that was extremely tiny. Soda is so cheap. Offer free refills or give bigger cups man.",2,4,2
"Cavanaugh's has all the trappings of a neighborhood bar: cheap beer, cheap food, more tv's per square inch than Best Buy... but it has one serious area it needs to improve on: lighting. The lights are always turned up to full blast, fully illuminating the shabby furnishings and shabbier patrons. I came to this bar once with some coworkers who had never been there before and upon entering they definitely experienced a ""what the hell"" moment as their senses tried to cope with the well-lit surroundings. We went on to have a pretty decent time as they were actually pretty happy with the on-tap beer selection (it's decent and cheap) but it's tough to recover from that initial shock and go on to declare the bar to be anything but a dive. Aspire to be something more, Cav's! Oh yeah, the wings are good though.",2,4,2
Great Philly diner experience. Perfect place for late night munchies. Their pies are great. Not too sweet. Always an interesting crowd.,3,5,2
"Such a great cheesesteak... when it has cheese... I love the Effin Hot Steak, and decided to give others a try. I decided to try the classic cheesesteak to see how it compares to other places I've been in Philly. But... even though I specifically asked for cheese whiz (yeah, I know some of you hate it, whatever)... I got NO CHEESE at all?!? WHAT THE EFF?!?",3,5,2
Went here for a quick bite to eat before heading to the DMV. I was surprised at how cheery and nice the woman in the drive-thru was. Props to her. Delicious hash browns!!,3,5,2
"Ever since I was little, my mother has taken me here for some good old fashioned pho. We still go today, if we get a hankering for some real stuff, not like the yuppie places at chinatown. We're talking 100% beef here. Unlike the small bowls they dish out at Pho 75 in chinatown, the portions here are pretty fair (everything near center city costs more). And the meat, specifically brisket, isn't banged up by fat like they have at Pho Xe. (As if my arteries need anymore of that.) The service is super fast- you'll love it. Their broth is savory, and lacks the synthetic taste I usually get when trying other joints. One note though- make sure your meat isn't raw when you eat it! Push it down to the bottom of the bowl so that it may cook. I usually order a number 12 ( a soup for beginners) and the brisket's usually pink in the middle. And make sure you don't overdue the hot sauce...or you may just leave with a bag of ice. So, how would I sum up what I just wrote? 1. The service is fast. 2. The stuff tastes awesome. 3. It's easy on the wallet. 4. You'll be full. Happy dining!",5,3,2
"When you consider all the fast food restaurants, you think the same for hear. But that's not the case, I don't consider here a fast food place, I consider it good food that's more on the healthy side. This is some of the best chicken I've had. Especially their sandwiches, the waffle fries are amazing, and there milk shakes are really some of the best. It's a great spot to go especially in the winter time with children they have a nice play area inside for the kids to enjoy themselves. Their menu is average, Great staff always polite, food is always warm never had a cold sandwich. With good menu price options. If ever get a chance try the breakfast, it's good. And worth getting. I'm more of the dinner kind of person when eating hear.",5,3,2
I haven't been to this place in a year or two. They used to put a lot of meat in their Vietnamese hoagies... But I guessed not anymore. I went there today... The hoagies were more bread then meat.,3,1,2
"Everything is good here (except the pumpkin cakes, way too dense and chalky), but of course the star is the steamed soup dumplings. Just keep the orders coming! If for some reason you don't want soup dumplings, because you've suddenly become a disappointing tasteless heathen, well fine, get the homemade noodles. Pork noodles and shanghai soup dumplings. DONE",5,3,2
"I ate here the other day with a friend of mine from town and the service was pretty trash. It wasn't very busy but the waitress we had Jessica took forever with our order, came back with cold food. Had to ask another waiter for refills on our drinks. Needs better service.",1,3,2
"I work near here and there aren't too many food options available. This place looks a bit grimey, lots of flies..eek. But I've ordered the plain slice here once before and it was good, hot, cheesy, thin, good crunchy crust. Today, i went in and asked what are the slices options. Usually pizza places have the slices on display...that should have been a big hint. The cashier listed off the options and i chose green peppers and onions. When I got it, I realized they put green peppers and onions and cheese on top off an already cooked pizza..obviously the veggies and new cheese aren't cooked just heated...and slid right off. I would have much much rather preferred if they had only said plain.",2,4,2
"Im new to the neighborhood and a neighbor gave me their menu to try it out. We ordered cheese steaks and they were pretty good. So I decided to give them another try and order an steak panzarotti one night. I haven't laughed so hard in years, they clearly have no idea what a panzarotti is, the gave me this huge monstrosity that was doughy and not fried. I don't know why I can't find a good panzarotti in Philly, but I know not to order it from goodys as well.",3,1,2
We went for the lunch buffet and were displeased to say the least. Honestly it's overpriced for a buffet. The food is mediocre and definitely not worth the price. A can of soda is $2.25!! The place seems unorganized with servers running around the dining area and you are unsure of whether to seat yourself and where to pay.,1,3,2
"I ordered a veggie pizza and a chicken parmesan with the spaghetti, the food was very nice, the sauce chicken parmesan could've had more sauce and cheese on it but otherwise the food was satisfactory. However, when I first ordered it the first on the phone took my order, first said the address and I said yes, took my order after I said it was for delivery. This is my second time ordering from this place by delivery because before I would just go and order in person but sometimes I'll do delivery as I have very recently started doing, there's some background for you. Now for tonight that this happened I was not asked for any of my card information by the girl that took my order, so I assumed that my information must've already been in the system since she hadn't asked for anything, much later however I get a call, from the first one I assume was the guy that delivered, but I didn't know the number off the bat, at least that's what I'm assuming I have no idea, but I do have Stacy's saved in my phone so when I saw the name I obviously knew who it was, I picked up and got the call about the order and the girl said it was still open, that confused me because I was under the impression that it had been paid for, and when she asked if I ordered off of GrubHub I was like ""Uhh no."" like what is this call for I'm confused? Then she said it was still open and I was confused, like why would it be open if as I am assuming my information must've still be in the system? But it turns out it was not, I asked if she wanted the card number she said yeah, I gave her the card number and my stuff was paid for, but after that I was like ""If you needed my card number still then why didn't you ask for it???"", they probably think I tried scamming them out of their money now and for me personally that down not sit well with me. The very first time I ordered from them by delivery was when I ordered my Fettuccine Chicken Alfredo and a Greek Pizza, idk why I didn't call about it that I will never understand why myself my brain probably wasn't thinking, but I got a pizza with cheese and promises instead of Greek, at first glance I was like ""Uuuhhh...is this how Greek Pizza looks....???"" I took a bite of it and it didn't have any of the things that were supposed to be on a Greek pizza and I guess I just forgot about calling about it later that night since I was more into other things I had to get to, the one part of the order was correct though and though both didn't taste bad that wasn't the issue, the pizza apart of it was wrong. So so far I have had issues with delivery, the first one part of the order being completely wrong, and the second I apparently didn't pay for my food when I assumed that I had and that since the girl didn't ask anything my information must've been in the system already when in fact it wasn't, I'm not sure if I wanna order by delivery again from this place, I think I'll just stick with in person ordering.",3,1,2
"Three simple words: Tasty. Friendly. Noisy. The pizza we ordered was flawless. Well, it had to be, since we build it ourselves. Server (Sokol) was great, too. Very friendly, fast and courteous. The only thing about this place is that if you're coming to have a romantic dinner, or meaningful conversation, you're not going to experience either. The one time we went there, it was freakin' loud...after about 10 minutes, we stopped trying to talk to each other, finished the meal and left.",3,5,2
"I enjoyed the atmosphere: it looks like an up-scale restaurant, dim lights, oldies playing in the background, and spotless floors. They have a fairly large bar and according to my friend, their drinks are pretty good. There is also a very big lounge upstairs. Now onto the food.. I have to say they were a disappointment. I was expecting some really good fried chicken but it was a big let down. The chicken was big and dry. Their chicken sliders were drizzled with honey which i enjoyed very much. The sides were the most disappointing. How do you mess up string beans! They OD on the salt to the point that it was bitter, and the caramelized yams were like hard candy. Way too sweet . The spare ribs, potato salad and mac and cheese were the best of all we ordered, and still they were just OK in my opinion. All in all, I was hoping for good food but Ms Tootsies is a big waste for a high price! Furthermore, our waitress seemed distracted and gave us an attitude, which I am going to boldly say is because we were the only Asians. Would NOT come here again.",1,3,2
"Ooooh, don't mind me. I've been drankin'. It's Friday night. During quarantine. And I'm writing this review while tipsy. During quarantine. And guess what?! I'm STILL gonna write it. During quarantine. Because... it's Friday night. During quarantine. So THERE. Ha! Tonight I was craving for a steak. Unfortunately, many of the steak spots in my area aren't open for sit down, and the waits for takeout are just too long for me to bare right now. So for a split second... I thought about getting a cheesesteak. And then I thought about Jim's, and I just had to quickly change my mind. You see, I live in the great state of Cali. The problem with this is that the cheesesteaks here are nowhere near as delicious as the one that I had at Jim's. Nowhere NEAR it. I wasn't about to disappoint myself by getting a below second rate cheesesteak from a chain that isn't even all that great. The saying is true; once you've had a Philly cheesesteak from PHILLY bay-baaaaay... you will never look at a cheesesteak the same way ever again. Had my first real Philly cheesesteak at Jim's South Street and hunty; they did not disappoint. Didn't receive the warmest welcome from the staff when I stepped into that joint, but you gotta realize the sitch' right quick. It was late night, and most of the peeps who creep here in the late hours are probably drunk as hell. You gotta have thick skin to deal with the drunkards, so I understand. It's pretty simple; You walk in, look at the menu board (if you have to), choose what you want and tell them at the counter. Then, walk down and pay at the register. You'll wait for your food and then you can take it upstairs to eat it if you wanna dine in. Since it was my first time getting a real Philly cheesesteak, I had to go with the original. Yuuup. Ya girl got that good ol' Philly Phil sammich! Sh*t was the f*ck GOODT. Sorry to be so vulgar but it truly was. Just imagine this beautifully soft roll of bread, filled with most tender, juicy thin slices of steak, sandwiched between cheese so melted that it practically turns into strings when you pull the sandwich halves apart. And all of that tasty juice and oil dripping in pure glory. So, normally I wouldn't be a fan of the messy mess. I'm light weight bougie wit it (don't you dare judge). I just hate gettin' sh*t all over my mouth, hands, and clothes, especially grease. BUT... I just couldn't get enough of it here. Couldn't get ENOUGH. Gimme da grease puh-lease! Give it TO me. Not only was this cheesesteak juicy as all hell, but it was meatier than life itself. Flavored for the GAWDS. Givin' me all of this extra life that I didn't even know that I needed. Yes, I loved it. And yes, I want some more... damnit. Heavenly is what I'll call it. How I'll describe it. Yeah... that part. If you eat upstairs, they have this ""guard"" who just sits there and watches you while you eat. A little annoying, slightly creepy, and down right uncomf, but I understand why they do it. Some of these damn peeps be actin' REAL cray cray. You'll have a nice little view of South street if you choose to sit by the window. The ""guard"" also cleans the tables once people leave. I guess homeboy ain't so bad after all. More than the cheesesteak though, I've gotta say, I truly enjoyed chatting it up with the staff. There was one older gentleman, didn't get his name. He was so hospitable. He heard my ""accent"" (I guess us Californians really do stand out, huh?!) and asked me where I was from. We instantly struck up a convo after that and he was so warm and welcoming toward me. That really made my night, especially since it was my first time there. Lawd. What I would give to have another one of dem cheesesteaks right about now. So damn good. If you're there right now, just make like Nike and DO IT. Have yourself a merry little cheesesteak and take full advantage of the drip. The grease drip that is. It's truly sensational. And you will love it. I can't wait for the day that I'll return to be reunited with that Philly cheesesteak again.",4,2,2
"So I think I would give El Camino 2 or 3 stars for the food but 4 or 5 for the service/atmosphere. I""ve been twice, and both times the food was just fine. The first time I ordered from the ""Tex"" side of the menu and got a seitan bbq sandwich, which just tasted kinda charred (in a bad way) and the bread was just white bread with lots of grease on it. I actually didn't even finish it, and it's pretty rare for me to leave behind food I've spent my hard-earned money on. This latest time I ordered from the ""Mex"" side, enticed by the cactus and sweet potato burritos. They were fine, but the tortilla was like the kind you would get at taco bell. And they weren't stuffed very full. My husband's two entrees there were similarly a let down. Although he did love the fried pickle chips. However when we went last weekend we had amazing service. I ordered the burrito without the cream sauce, and when they delivered the food, I hadn't even taken a bite yet before they came and snatched it away, apologizing profusely that they put the cream in. Throughout the next few minutes it took to make a new one, several people apologized to me, and the server even took the blame (classic server move is ALWAYS blame the kitchen!) and took the burrito and one of our apps off the check! All this and I never even had to take a bite of it and then wait to bring it to the server's attention, which is the usual route a dairy-less eater has to take, all the time. I also just can't get over how much I love the natural-cut wood tables and bar. Both times we had to wait, but not long. My husband is eyeing up the veggie wings and is dying to go back soon for just drinks and apps.",4,2,2
good beer & an amazing wild mushroom salad .. yum,3,5,2
"Since my last review the DD on City Line seems to have gotten a little religion. I was desperate sleepy and had to drive, and went to the drive thru here - I was much more pleasantly surprised. They actually got my order right and asked me if everything was okay when they made change. So maybe there's some hope for this place after all.",3,1,2
"What a let down! For years all the popular food shows have told me it is one of the best philly cheese steaks. It is definitely commercialized and was probably better before these shows made it a tourist spot because thats what it is. They charge you $9.50 for a less than good sandwich. All i got out if it was being able to say I ate at Genos. Being from NY its like me saying Rays pizza is New York's spot for Pizza (Definitely not). The little bit of meat on the sandwich was tough, the onions were raw, and the fries were ice cold. And another thing that bothered me was that they didn't cut the sandwich in half. Gotta ask a local where the Philadelphians get their Philly cheese steaks.",1,3,2
"Here is everything you need to know about the people who run New Deck: On St. Patrick's Day, they had NO drink specials and charged $5 for a pint of Guinness. Another time, they tried to charge us a $2 cover to eat dinner. We ate somewhere else that night, obviously. Also, their ""bouncer"" is completely psycho. Note to bouncer: This is a college bar. Penn is not a state school. You know what that means? People come here from out of state! Stop acting like ""California"" and ""Ohio"" are fake states that don't grant driver's licenses and let me have a damn drink already.",3,1,2
"I've been wanting to go here for almost a year and finally went with a friend. The space is pretty large and there are a lot of tables. Ambiance is really nice too so I think this would be a nice place for a date if you don't mind the noise. It was kind of crowded when we went (Sunday morning around 10:30) but we still got seated without waiting. When we left (around 12) there were quite a few parties waiting to be seated so I would arrive early if you don't want to wait. Even though it was pretty busy, our waitress was very attentive! She was also really nice which is worth noting since I find that service at most places is average. Food came out quickly too. We got the huevos rancheros, buttermilk pancakes, fruit salad, matcha latte, and London fog. Everything tasted pretty good but I think next time I will definitely try the cannoli French toast. If you're looking for a brunch place, definitely check out Cafe Lift.",5,3,2
Would be 5/5 except for the slight grains of sand up in my grain bowl... that kale was not properly massaged and washed... tragic.,4,2,2
"A true historic restaurannt with authentic atmosphere, good service and food.",3,5,2
"This place is A fun place to go when you have nowhere else to go. I highly recommend it on a week day over the weekends any day. This place isn't like what used to be the bouncers have Changed so many new faces. The Bouncers outside Complete a******'s. The guys on the inside are so much nicer. The music downstairs is for old heads they also have up stairs which Plays a lot of hip hop I prefer be downstairs because I have to deal with Ignorant spoiled college kids. I do recommend their food the Barbecue chicken and the Buffalo chicken sandwiches are usually my favorite. The bar back guy upstairs with the longbeard Looks like he never showers But other than that you can have fun with this place When girls start to Dance all over you, now that i love!",3,5,2
"We live in the neighborhood and had higher expectations after reading that this is the best ramen spot in Philly. Do yourself a favor--especially when the wait is long--go a few doors down to Zhi Izakaya--SO good! Back to this place--We both had miso ramen and found the broth too fatty and salty. For the record, we are ramen fiends and have recently had far better in NY. Also, for a Chinatown restaurant, we noticed there are hardly any Asian customers or chefs!",3,5,2
"Everything they say about ST's food and beer is absolutely true, great stuff. But for my last lunch there I had all to do to keep my wife in her chair, our waiter, nice kid, was just about the grungiest creature I've ever seen, hair not washed for weeks, 10:00 O'clock shadow, dirty shirt with a kitchen rag hanging out of the back pocket of the nastiest jeans that was a mini vomitorium stiff with grease, old food an kitchen stains. All the bric a brac had years of dust. Picked at our food, not much of an appetite, though we came in hungry. If I was health inspector, I'd have thrown yellow tape across the entrance until they threw the entire restaurant and staff in a lake of soapy water. Do restaurant and bar owners think that simply because they're popular they can do anything? There are about 12,000 restaurants/bars in Philly and a lot of them serve good food and are clean!",3,1,2
"Great food and service. I forgot to ask for lettuce and tomatoes when I ordered. But I asked for it afterward, they still gave it to me on the side.",4,2,2
"I was tricked into coming here by my husband with promises of Whack A Mole and Skeet Ball...Turns out this Bar/arcade only has old school video games. NO WHACK-A-MOLE. Oh well, I had to drown my sorrows in some pretty good beer options on tap. This place is chock full of hipsters. I may have been the only person there without glasses and skinny jeans. What do you expect with the location of this place though. Bartenders were pretty nice and quick to get you a drink. I thought their system of keeping BOTH my license and credit card to keep the tab open was really strange and made me a little nervous. It's one thing if I happen to forget my card, or it gets lost (hey things happen in bar.) It's a whole 'nother story if something were to happen to my license. (It would involve a trip back to my home state of CT and a whole day wasted at the DMV). It made me just a little nervous. I may be paranoid but whatevs. I will def. bring cash if I ever come back here. My husband's main reason for wanting to come here was Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. He played a few nostalgic rounds and then remembered he was 30. It was a fun concept, it's just one I will never feel inclined to experience again.",2,4,2
"Great food. Food arrived in a timely manner but.....Apathetic service. We asked if we could eat at outdoor table. Looked like they were no longer setting outside tables but hostess said "" the gas station gets armed robberies "" so you can eat outside at your own risk. Weird. Seated inside next to Kitchen and despite the service team walking by many times I had to flag down a server. Who didn't seem to want to be bothered. When I asked about specials he curtly said "" nope , everything is there in black and white on the menu. In sum the wait staff acted like they were anxious to be done for the evening and paid more attention to setting the tables than the customers.",3,1,2
"I'm no donut snob. In fact, I don't like donuts all that much. So it was a surprise to me that I decided to stop in my tracks and get a donut today. I went with a friend. She ordered blueberry mascarpone. I had a taste and decided it was too fancy pants for me. Instead, I ordered a plain glazed donut. It was freaking delicious. This donut didn't taste like any other donut I have ever had. It was much more cake like and less fast food-ish. It put me in a huge sugar coma and I napped for three hours afterwards. I think this place would be a good cure for insomnia. I don't plan on making this a staple of my diet. Maybe a once a year indulgence. Good to know it exists.",5,3,2
"Sunday brunch in Philly and wanted to try Booker's. They have vegan choices so it's right up my alley. Found street parking a few doors up and walked in. The hostess stand and further back in the restaurant. When I approach the hostess there were employees sitting at the bar area and a man from the kitchen was having a conversation about not serving dinner items cause it's brunch. The conversation should have taken place in the back of the restaurant away from the front where customers enter. Was asked if we had reservations which we didn't. The restaurant was basically empty with the exception of 2 tables occupied. We didn't like our first seats and asked about another table but was told it was reserved. We asked for another table and was told ok. That not good customer service. The hostess should of provided options. Received a pitcher of water. Then the waitress Shay took our order. She was very nice and asked the kitchen to add more spice to my tofu scramble. My friend ordered fish and grits with a English muffin for an extra $2. Shay also told us about Brunch specials not on the menu. The food was good and the servicing size is in line with the price. I really enjoyed the food. It can put quick too. Areas of Opportunity: table was not wiped off/down, hair was on plate that silverware was served on, had to ask 2x for coffee, hostess is not very inviting. They have jazz every Wednesday night from 6-9. I will most definitely come back.",3,1,2
Get here before 10AM or after 1PM to avoid the rush. Cash only (there's an ATM on-site). But this is diner food in all of its glory.,4,2,2
"I like their food...I specifically like the dry pepper fish. Crispy (not oily) good heat, big flavor. Tonight I got delivery ( which I have in the past. Just know it's not super speedy). I always order the scallion pancake (along with the dry pepper fish). When ordering from delivery the scallion pancake tend to get soggy because of the condensation. I wish they would put them in a plastic container with holes in the lid to let the steam out. They pack them in a cardboard rice container. This time, they didn't come with dipping sauce, which was disappointing. When dining in, know that it's a byob, which is a plus. If you like big flavor and heat, this is your place.",4,2,2
The food is all very heavy. Not the best Philly cheesesteak I've had. Cool place to walk around though.,3,5,2
"Ok I have now become a regular and it def. deserves 5 stars! I have since tried almost all the sandwiches and have never been disappointed. It has been quite some time that I found a place that I want to go to daily. Sometimes I dash in for a quick coffee and other times I linger for a long time reading, chatting, and just being happy to know there are still neighborhood places where people care enough to not just remember your name but get to know ya. Super Cool!",5,3,2
"Got in early (40 min. Before showtime). Quick service. Good food and drinks. Good layout for a comedy club. Would be a better comedy venue if the ceilings were lower, but not every place can be a comedy cellar...",5,3,2
"Went here for lunch during a week day. It was totally packed. You order food at the counter and then they give you a buzzer to call you when it is ready. The trouble was, the food took too long. The other trouble was the options of burgers. You can 'build your own' burger which starts at $8 and change BUT if you keep adding fixins and toppings the price really racks up. For 2 burgers, reg onion rings and fries and 2 drinks it was over $40. Yea, I know right? The food was average for sure. That is until the incident. Where my girlfriend took one of the last bites of her burger and pulled out a long, very black, synthetic piece of hair (a weave to be sure, since it didnt snap from pulling). It wasn't just on top where it had fallen from a server's head. No. This was IN the meat. It was ground up in there which meant it fell in while constructing the patties. And I watched her pull it out of her mouth. It was like a never ending thick black rope. Needless to say, my GF bolted to the bathroom where she proceeded to lose her lunch. It sucks because the food wasn't horrible. Overpriced, but goodish. Things happen and we told the manager the issue and he was totally cool about it. He refunded our order in its entirety and even offered us a shake - which we passed. If I had to rate the place just on the manager, I would give 4 stars as he didnt waver and just dealt with the issue. 1 star is missing for a long wait time for food and drink machine was out of most flavors. 1 star is missing for finding a weave in our food. To that manager out there, thanks for owning the situation and making it right. Because of that, I would try it again if for whatever reason I pass up on the reading terminal.",3,1,2
"If I would go, I'd like to go some where that's closer to home, nothing special about this place. I bought an expired canned fish here .",3,1,2
"I love Couch Tomato's salads. Yes, love them. I thought I already wrote a review for Couch Tomato and went to give them an update based on their catering salads alone. Their specialty salads are fresh and fun. They are chalk full of delicious ingredients that almost take away the salad/health aspect. My favorites are the Food Pyramid (spinach, roasted chicken strawberries, cucumbers, candied pecans & shredded mozzarella) and the Where's Waldorf (mixed greens, freshly sliced apples, gorgonzola, candied pecans & raisins). There are so many pizza and salad places within the Manayunk and surrounding areas that are just so mediocre. Unfortunately, many times when a catered lunch shows up to the office it's from one of those mediocre places. It's always exciting when we get Couch Tomato. It's not very often that I love every part of a salad that I didn't pick out myself or didn't have to make a handful of substitutions with. Their pizzas are pretty good too. I typically stick to the salads but there are a lot of fun topping combos. I typically limit my 5 star ratings to restaurants that I have a more experiential interaction with, however Couch Tomato really stands out in the unique salad category.",5,3,2
"Excellent dishes for brunch today- including samplers of eggplant, hummus, dolmas, olives- all the typical yummy Greek treats. Today these included a fascinating beet purée and a smooth pistachio and feta dip, which was phenomenal. Entrees included an interesting smoked trout served in flavorful (but not spicy) rice, and a creative lamb sausage with eggs. Presentation was excellent, service too. Very fresh ingredients and everything came out piping hot. The score would easily have been a four or five, but oddly Kanella decided to cheap out on little things. Extra pita bread for the $20 worth of samplers dinged us another $3. And the coffee is French press. $10 for 3 cups. So six cups of coffee for three people ran us $20. Very nice space, and tasty food, but watch for the sneaky extra charges.",3,5,2
"I live right in the market, much to the envy of friends and family. (OK, not all of them... but enough that I can feel smug about it on occasion.) On weeks when I'm more inclined to cook, I couldn't ask for a better location. Fresh is the key word here--produce, meat, pasta and the like are much better than what you get at the grocery store, and generally for a fraction of the price. And the cheese selection is unbeatable. I've been skipping DiBruno's lately in favor of Claudio because it's slightly less claustrophobic. I should skip them both, because living a block away from Brie that melts when you look at it is not good for one's waistline. Word to the wise: there's something like a law of diminishing returns with the produce. You have to find the sweet spot, which is roughly across the street from DiBruno's. Go north of that and you'll pay too much for the same fruits and veggies; go south and you'll pay the same for stuff that's about to rot. And I implore you--do NOT miss the Italian Market Festival, held the weekend before Memorial Day each year. There's food, beer, wine and merriment stretching from Catherine St. south to about Federal or Wharton. Come hungry!",5,3,2
"I went early on the spur of the moment so I don't know what happens when they are booked. However, my meal was delicious and the service was friendly. We needed a place with flavor in Chestnut Hill.",5,3,2
"Tell me, have you ever dreamed of dancing in Havana? Well, look no further because, at Cuba Libre, you will be dancing ( rumba, meringues, salsa & merengue) side-by-side with Professional Latin dancers. Every Fridays and Saturdays, so mark your calendar. For a taste of the forbiden island, you might want to give this (celebration of flavor and comfort) a try. - Try the Del Mar rapid ( seafood Soup, shrimp ceviche and MahiMahi fillet.) This trios will take your lunch up a notch. $14.75 - Also, you can't beat the highly flavorful Cuban bento box. the selection is changed weekly and cost $16.5 - Any mojito will be a very GOOD accompaniment to any meal. Or better yet, alone, if you'd like. Tell me, again, why you shouldn't have another one anytime you want? Three and half Yelps.",3,5,2
I've been coming here for a few years now and find the food to be really good... Sometimes even great! Great atmosphere and always friendly service. Be sure to prepare yourself to wait since this place has become pretty popular over years.,3,5,2
Why the hell does this place get 5 stars?? Solely because of the waffles. The perfectly cooked and heavenly waffles. The other food they have here I would say is just so-so. THOSE WAFFLES THOUGH!,5,3,2
"Stumbled (literally) onto this place a few days ago. Head down Chestnut til you hit the crowd of smokers outside and you're in Vegas. Well, not really, the decor has really nothing to do with Vegas. What a shame, a ""Vegas"" schtick bar might be a great idea. The bartenders are nice, they keep the bar flowing, music selection is very good (Kinks followed by Chris Cornell followed by Kelly Clarkson) but like I said it's not Vegas without some Elvis, Manilow, and Tom Jones. Their Chicken Cheesesteak is amazing for a non-cheesesteak place and with a $3 draft special, it tastes even better. Fries deserve a shoutout... Hey-yo! If you're looking for a non-dressy place to just simply hang without getting hit on over and over, head to Vegas.",4,2,2
"If you've ever been to a Krispy Kreme when the hot donuts light is on, you know how much better a fresh, warm donut is than one that has been sitting on the shelf for a while. The donuts at Federal put Krispy Kreme to shame. So far I've been twice and have tried the vanilla pretzel donut and the cinnamon brown sugar donut. The vanilla pretzel was off the shelf but still very good. The flavor was surprisingly complex. The cinnamon brown sugar donut was fresh and amazing. There was nothing particularly unique about the flavor itself, but suffice to say if Plato asked me about the Ideal Form of a true donut, I would point him toward Federal and tell him to ask for whatever is fresh. While the fancy donuts do run a tiny bit high at $2, their less fancy bretheren are just as good and clock in at just $1.25. Perhaps that is pricey for a donut, but honestly Dunkin charges .89 a pop for a VASTLY inferior product. Comparing Federal to Dunkin is like comparing the best meatballs in the Italian market to Ikea Horse Balls. The extra 36 cents is most definitely worth it.",5,3,2
"I come here all the time and I love their food. I don't if it was because they were extremely busy but the counter girls attitudes were HORRIBLE! Ma Sheena in particular was not accommodating at all. If a person orders cheese fries they want cheese fries. I nicely expressed that I'm paying for cheese and I've gotten very little. She goes on to say this is the amount that we are supposed to give. I say that I order quite frequently is this is the first time the ever looked like this. You says ""if you want more cheese you have to pay for it."" On a regular day I would have asked for my money back and went elsewhere but I was starving. I asked the other counter girl she was working with if I paid for a milk shake because when she handed me my food she proceeded to the next customer. She tell me wait I'll get to it. Well say that. Don't just proceed to the next person in line without giving me my complete order. Service was just terrible today. Please fix it...",3,1,2
"We were cracking up the whole way here as our cab driver was a total riot, and did not have any comprehension of my friend's vegetarianism. That said, we were off to a great start and knew the pilgrimage we made as a break from the convention center was well worth it! As this was featured on the food network, this was THE place we had to go for cheesesteaks. We had the provolone wit's, oh, and my veggie friend had the whiz wit. (Veggie status can be suspended for momentous occasions - real cheesesteaks in philly certainly qualifies!). The cheesesteaks were good; not extraordinary, but goo, and fun! The cheesefries were really good! I hear Pat's is better so we are already planning our next trip out to Philly to give them a try!",3,5,2
"I finally got a calzone!!! What's it been, like 18 years since I've experienced this beautiful pocket of folded over pizza love. Blackbird's dough is so good. So good. I appreciate that they do it right here. So I had pretty high hopes for a vegan calzone though I was a bit worried about the ricotta. Turns out I had nothing to fear. It's tasty. I wonder if they make it. If any of y'all have had Primacotta, it tastes kind of like that. Not sure if I'd recommend the calzone to curious non-vegans, but for me it was just right. I got it with pepperoni and sausage which I always enjoy on the slices. Yum. And less hard on the stomach than a dairy cheese bomb. Anyway, the pizza slices are good because the ingredients are good and properly applied like expensive makeup applied following a YouTube tutorial. I like the style of pizza made though sometimes I wish for more tomato sauce. They keep the Daiya light which is the right thing to do in this situation. I've had a few sandwiches and a caesar salad and they're not bad, pretty solid actually, but I've yet to reorder anything. I usually swing in for a few slices on my vegan food tours of Philly. If I lived in the area, I'd eat here all the time.",5,3,2
"The food was great (4.5 star), the service was not (2 star). Averaging a 3 star rating. My party and I went out for lunch on Black Friday and the restaurant was moderately busy but not terribly so. The food was really good and I feel we got a decent deal (premium party course) which worked out to about $90 for four people after taxes and not including tip and we all left pleasantly full. The downside to the visit however was the service, or lack thereof. 1. We didn't receive any drink refills (waters or soda) even though we asked. Upon bringing the check the waitress finally refilled our waters. Thanks, I guess? 2. Had to ask twice for forks. 3. Waitress forgot the additional sauces we ordered until reminded. 4. We asked for additional mushrooms and zucchini mid-meal, never received but at least we weren't charged for something we didn't get. 5. I found out after leaving that apparently another person in my party had ordered something else that too had not been delivered. I left a feedback card with items 1-4, but I doubt management saw it since we left it on the table upon leaving. I didn't see a general manager at the location and I didn't think to leave it with the hostess upon exiting. My young brother paid for the meal for our party as thanks for flying him out for the holidays and taking him up to see Philly and honestly I felt embarrassed having him do so due to the service we received. I expected better. If my husband and I still lived in Philadelphia we'd probably give this restaurant another shot attributing this to an off day, but since we don't and this was an out-of-our-way meal we will probably avoid in the future.",3,1,2
Three and half stars! Would order from here again. Placed the order at 7:40 and it was biked over at 8:15. Fab. Especially since I live like a 15 minute bike ride away. Sweet potato roll and shrimp tempura roll and yellowtail roll were all delish.,3,1,2
"This is a review of the diner side only. Why it is called a diner is beyond me. I guess the fact that they have the layout of a traditional diner makes it easy to give it that name, but the food is anything but diner fare. My only memory of being at this place before was when I enjoyed some delicious pb&j bread pudding.... a long time ago. On this visit the menu came as something of a shock. Mussels, cilantro calamari, blackened fish tacos, asian spiced tuna burger, etc..... I was really in the mood for diner food, not fake fro fro grub in a lounge/diner. No need to visit again for the food, but will probably be back at the lounge at some point.",2,4,2
"From the outside it looks like a bit of a chain so I didn't visit until a friend invited me to lunch. I was so impressed and so full! I am on my second punch card after only a year. The family that runs Pita Chip is so kind and care about their customers. Their portions are [way too] big and I have never been able to finish a bowl in one sitting. Every though I have been a customer for a while, it was their catering that prompted me to write this review. A client ordered for dinner the other night and it was just as good as I had hoped! The only odd thing was that the wraps came in actual wraps when I think we were all expecting pita bread. Not their fault - it's called a wrap! Just seemed off brand. Would recommend this place to anyone.",5,3,2
"I've been a loyal Loco customer at the Fishtown location since I discovered it two years ago - I could live and die by their nachos. Scoring a heaping pile of perfectly layered chips, cheese, and fresh toppings for $5 make it one of my top 3 favorite Happy Hour locations in the city. However, when I heard there was a new location opening a few blocks from my office, I was more skeptical than excited. However, upon my recent venture to check it out, I was pleasantly surprised. Unlike the dingy, yet charming cramped quarters in Fishtown, the new location has a lot more room to sit; more space, more tables, a bigger bar, and more stools. It's also got a very sleek, modern vibe with big TVs behind the bar; less of a dive-y feel than the OG Loco Pez. The staff was very quick to greet and seat us, but the service beyond the hostess was super slow. It took about 10 minutes after sitting before we were greeted by our server and offered water glasses, and we saw him on 3 other times in the 2 and a half hours we were there. Fortunately, my friend and I weren't in any hurry. Unfortunately, about halfway through catching up, we noticed, quite abruptly, that the music was turned up way too loud. We were shouting to hear each other across the table. I'm not sure why the music was turned up so suddenly, but it was very disruptive to seemingly everyone who was trying to have a conversation. You can't beat the $5 nachos and the overall atmosphere was inviting. Just turn down the beats.",4,2,2
Update... So I had refrigerated the last remaining piece of chicken (large fried chicken breast) over night. Was hungry the next afternoon (Monday) noticed the left over chicken in the fridge decided to eat it. I was in a rush so I didn't bother to reheat (next day fried chicken is always still good but rarely crispy). Andy's chicken was still super crispy and just as delicious as it was fresh from the fryer.,5,3,2
"This is a continuation of the previously written review: After the servers argument, he offered for them to cook me a new one, I agreed, but hubby was done at that point and he had had it, I saw a side back waiter and asked him to just bring my overcooked steak back, wrapped and we were ready for the check. The creamed spinach was good, not grand, the Greenburg potato skins were pure fried potato skins, no potato at all and served with a sour cream and horseradish sauce. Do it at home and save the big bucks. My big dilemma is we have more open table certificates that we would have loved to have used and we have no problem mentioning yelp, but they do, so I'm trying to even reason why I would want to return at this point Douglas? I hope you enjoyed your unwarranted $50.00 tip... Oh and I do hope that you read my little note on the receipt. The staff used to be welcoming, accommodating and friendly, seems to have gotten a bit snobbish, but I can take my $50.00 tips elsewhere and get a filet cooked properly without the sideshow. The service used to be stellar, but those days are gone. It's now a great place for older worn out men trying to pick up very used ""ladies"" or so it seemed, the blend of tables from floor to floor and the acoustics left conversations flow though out the restaurant, this is what made my night, have your piano player come in earlier. BTW, I made a dry aged standing rib roast for Christmas and hubby said it put yours to shame, I can also teach you how to cook a proper steak.",1,3,2
"Nice donut shop. I would recommend the warm donuts There seemed to be an issue with the draft latte as it was mostly foam, but they were happy to give us another one to make up for it.",5,3,2
"Perfect for getting together with friends ... stay warm and cozy inside on a chilly night or feel the breeze outside (possibly emanating from a VERY LOUD bus) during the summer. As a 30-year-old a bit too fancy to truly appreciate Doobie's, the Pub and Kitchen definitely serves as a favorite neighborhood bar. I must say the Blueberry Cosmo is divine, and I'm not one to ever endorse a Cosmo. However, I have to ding the Pub and Kitchen for a) removing the po' boy - a remarkably good sandwich - from the menu and b) clearly downgrading the quality of the meat in their chicken wings. Given how busy this place gets, it seems to me they could take more pride in the food.",3,5,2
"I decided to try the brick house grilled cheese and expected more than I got for $11. The bread was grilled very nicely with a crunchy buttery outside. The sandwich had a half a slice of braised beef, just a few sprinkled mushrooms and was loaded with onions. I was very disappointed.",2,4,2
"One of my regular joints. Good marketing move to paint it a bright orange to catch your eye as you walk/drive by. Owner is very cheerful and friendly but some might find him in your face a tad bit. He will always walk you through the menu and make it just the way you want him to. My top choice is the ""Crazy Chaat"" and the lamb roll, with papri chaat and chicken roll pretty close. My non-meat eating friends have complimented the veg roll also. Personally I always ask him to leave out the raddish as chaat does not really come with that. The best way to round up is Paan Ice cream!!! The mango Lassi can do with some work on it tho!!!",3,5,2
"I had the Hot sausage egg and cheese. It was pretty amazing their pork roll egg and cheese is ok but definitely doesn't have enough pork roll, but not bad overall. The hot sausage is definitely where it's at if you like sausage you'll love this place.",5,3,2
"Before trying BF last night, I tried to find a price range that I could expect to spend on dinner. It's tough to calculate without knowing the sizes of each dish. I offer this review to remedy that: Party: 2 people, moderate eaters. Usually find entrees at an average restaurant to be pretty filling. Price: We got a $21 pitcher of sangria, and the rest of our food came to about $65 including dessert. This got enough plates to fill us, and leave no left-overs. I'd say that is a decent gauge for how much you can expect to spend on dinner. If you have a large appetite, it will obviously be a bit more. I'll leave the food reviews to more seasoned foodies, but in my opinion the 8 or so plates we got were delicious and unique. The service was better than most restaurants, but it was a Sunday night and there weren't many other customers.",5,3,2
"Would have been an easy 5 star. Great food and service. But the music (96.5 FM) and volume leads to indigestion. Note to trendy restaurant owners, don't play lousy music at any decibel level. And tune your speakers so I don't have to hear loud static. Patrons want to dine, not to be subjected to the eccentric music tastes of your employees",3,1,2
"Delicious! It really seems like you can't go wrong with anything you order here! If you know me, I always have the most difficult time choosing what to order. Here, that wasn't a problem. Our appetizer was the Edamame Ravioli, which I saw in a lot of the other reviews. (I think we got jipped with the dish though, since ours only came with three pieces and other pictures show a lot more-- one picture even has 6! Maybe they give you as many pieces as you have people.) But it did not disappoint. I also set my sights on the fish dishes-- Miso Black Cod and Sea Bass. I couldn't decide which one I liked better but, in the end, I think I preferred the Miso Black Cod. The Curried Cauliflower was aaaamazing, too! Especially for just being a dish with that name. It came with cashews and had some spice to it. We all loved our food, and I can't wait to come back for more!",5,3,2
"Felled by a tummy bug last night. I was ready to graduate from nibbling on a piece of toast all day - But there was no broth to be found in the freezer today. I started browsing Caviar and found this welcome new addition to the area. We live in dark times, but I was able to order pretty tasty chicken soup on the internet and someone kindly brought it to my house. They were out of my chosen broth, but called moments after I placed my order and gave me the option of any other. Hangover broth has just a tiny bit of kick. Pleased to report it was not inappropriate for a recovering tum. It was a little spendy (esp w Caviar fees), but portion size was good and ingredients were fresh, broth was homemade and not overly salty with spot on spices. Would gladly order again in occasions of soup emergency. And if I were nearby I would stop in just because it is good.",5,3,2
"Got Sicilian pizza and wings. Pizza wasn't completely cooked and wings were ""old"" ( cool and dry). Pizza would have been great if it was baked completely.",3,1,2
